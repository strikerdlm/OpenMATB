# OpenMATB Mission Expansion Manual

This manual captures a concrete plan for extending OpenMATB to cover two high-value aviation contexts—Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) operators and high-performance aircraft crews—using the existing plugin-driven architecture. The current implementation work is attributed to **Dr Diego Malpica, Aerospace Medicine**, who is curating these enhancements for translational research use.

## 1. Architecture Reference Points

OpenMATB exposes each task as a plugin derived from `AbstractPlugin`, which already manages lifecycle, widget scaffolding, and logging hooks:

```143:151:plugins/abstractplugin.py
    def start(self):
        if self.verbose:
            print('Start ', self.alias)
            print('with keys ', self.keys)
        self.alive = True
        self.create_widgets()
        self.log_all_parameters(self.parameters)
        self.show()
        self.resume()
```

Scenarios bind those plugins at runtime, so new training tasks only need scenario directives plus a concrete plugin class:

```17:48:core/scenario.py
class Scenario:
    '''
    This object converts scenario to Events, loads the corresponding plugins,
    and checks that some criteria are met (e.g., acceptable values)
    '''
    def __init__(self, contents=None):
        self.events = list()
        self.plugins = dict()

        if contents is None:
            scenario_path = P['SCENARIOS'].joinpath(get_conf_value('Openmatb', 'scenario_path'))
            if scenario_path.exists():
                contents = open(scenario_path, 'r').readlines()
                logger.log_manual_entry(scenario_path, key='scenario_path')
            else:
                errors.add_error(_('%s was not found') % str(scenario_path), fatal = True)

        # Convert the scenario content into a list of events #
        # (Squeeze empty and commented [#] lines)
        self.events = [Event.parse_from_string(line_n, line_str) for line_n, line_str
                       in enumerate(contents)
                       if len(line_str.strip()) > 0 and not line_str.startswith("#")]

        # Next load the scheduled plugins into the class, so we can check potential errors
        # But first, check that only available plugins are mentioned
        for event in self.events:
            if not hasattr(globals()['plugins'], event.plugin.capitalize()):
                errors.add_error(_('Scenario error: %s is not a valid plugin name (l. %s)') % (event.plugin, event.line), fatal = True)

        self.plugins = {name: getattr(globals()['plugins'], name.capitalize())()
                        for name in self.get_plugins_name_list()}
```

The plan below assumes we keep leveraging those extension seams.

## 2. Use Case 1 – UAS Operator Workflows

Recent FAA research catalogued the KSAOs UAS crews need—airspace knowledge, mission planning, multi-sensor prioritisation, crew resource management, and stress tolerance—highlighting gaps in standardized training for BVLOS, multi-ship, and payload-intensive ops ([FAA UAS KSA study](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/data_research/research/med_humanfacs/oamtechreports/202114.pdf)). The MATB paradigm already trains multitasking, so the following modules map UAS-specific demands onto OpenMATB plugins:

| Module | Goal | Implementation Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Multi-UAV Mission Director** | Allocate automation resources across up to four simulated aircraft, forcing prioritisation of “launch, surveillance, divert, recover” chains. | Extend `plugins/scheduling.py` to render column-per-aircraft timelines with automation takeover toggles. Add events like `missiondirector;assign;uav2,surveillance,03:00`. |
| **Sense-and-Avoid & Geofence Monitor** | Train sense-and-avoid reasoning (declare traffic conflicts, select maneuvers within timeouts). | New plugin `senseandavoid.py` using text/gauge overlays and flashing alerts. Parameters: conflict rate, separation minima, allowable maneuvers. Scenario events drive intruder azimuth and altitude bands. |
| **Payload & Sensor Management** | Practice simultaneous sensor slewing, target confirmation, and bandwidth rationing. | Derive from `AbstractPlugin` to manage a grid of “sensor pods” with energy budgets. Each task update adjusts signal fidelity; operator must queue shots while respecting downlink capacity. |
| **Datalink & Crew Coordination** | Recreate high-volume chat/datalink message parsing plus crew callouts. | Build on `plugins/datalink.py` to stream controller–pilot data link (CPDLC) style prompts with prioritisation (aligned with NASA CPDLC workload findings [NASA TM–2020-0010384](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20200010384/downloads/20200010384.pdf); [NTRS 1989-0002355](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19890002355)). Keyboard shortcuts (UP/DOWN/ENTER) support queue triage, while scenario hooks drive message mixes. |

### UAS Reference Scenarios

- Added `includes/scenarios/uas_basic.txt`, a five-minute demonstration scenario that starts the legacy MATB tasks plus Mission Director, Sense-and-Avoid, Payload Manager, Datalink, and Physio Monitor. It scripts UAV assignments, two deconfliction events, multi-sensor load juggling, and CPDLC-style prompts so research teams can evaluate the modules together or reuse it as a template when generating progressive difficulty ramps via `scenario_generator.py`.
- Added `includes/scenarios/uas_bvlos.txt`, a BVLOS stress drill with three simultaneous aircraft, persistent datalink traffic, repeated sense-and-avoid conflicts, and payload juggling. This scenario is useful for benchmarking automation assistance or experimenting with adaptive autonomy toggles.

### Scenarios & Metrics

1. **Mission build-up** – start with two aircraft and low conflict density, add additional UAVs plus payload events every 90 s.
2. **Geofence breach drills** – randomly move virtual no-fly bubbles; operator must re-task aircraft within 10 s to avoid breach.
3. **Lost link and handover** – feed tasks that force mid-scenario plug-in swap (`missiondirector;failradio;uav3`), requiring the trainee to initiate scripted recovery.

Log lines of type `state`/`performance` already capture widget values. Add domain metrics: e.g., “time-in-breach,” “payload latency,” “conflict resolution choice,” and stream them through the existing LSL plugin for real-time analytics.

### Mission Director Implementation Status

- Added `plugins/missiondirector.py`, which exposes scenario commands `assign`, `complete`, `automation`, `conflict`, and `clearconflict` for up to six UAVs. Each row shows mission name, automation mode, countdown timers, and alerts, while overdue feedback flashes whenever conflicts are active.
- Scenario example:

  ```text
  0:00:05;missiondirector;start
  0:00:05;missiondirector;assign;uav1,launch,300
  0:00:30;missiondirector;automation;uav1,auto
  0:02:00;missiondirector;conflict;uav1,geofence
  0:02:10;missiondirector;clearconflict;uav1
  0:05:10;missiondirector;complete;uav1
  ```

- Performance metrics emitted: `mission_assign`, `mission_mode`, `mission_alert`, enabling correlation with other MATB workloads.

### Sense-and-Avoid Implementation Status

- Added `plugins/senseandavoid.py`, which displays a live intruder table (bearing, range, altitude delta, time-to-impact, status) and drives overdue feedback whenever conflicts exceed prescribed TTI or remain unresolved. Scenario commands include:
  - `senseandavoid;spawn;INTR1,090,2.0,300,45` (bearing 090°, 2nm, +300 ft, 45 s to conflict)
  - `senseandavoid;resolve;INTR1,turn right 20°`
  - `senseandavoid;clear;INTR1`
  - `senseandavoid;thresholds;1.0,400`
- Metrics logged: `saa_spawn`, `saa_resolve` (with resolution time), `saa_overdue`, and `saa_thresholds`, enabling comparisons against NASA asymptotic workload measures and FAA detect-and-avoid timing guidance.

### Payload & Sensor Management Implementation Status

- Added `plugins/payloadmanager.py`, which tracks sensor pods (energy %, assigned target, bandwidth) against total link capacity. Automatic depletion/recharge behaviour simulates power/bandwidth constraints; overdue alarms fire if total Mbps exceed the configured capacity or a pod goes fully depleted.
- Scenario hooks:

  ```text
  0:00:05;payloadmanager;start
  0:00:10;payloadmanager;activate;CamA,Target-Alpha,12
  0:00:20;payloadmanager;priority;CamA,18
  0:00:30;payloadmanager;activate;IRST,Target-Bravo,22
  0:02:00;payloadmanager;standby;CamA
  0:02:10;payloadmanager;recharge;CamA
  0:03:00;payloadmanager;capacity;60
  ```

- Logged metrics include `payload_activate`, `payload_priority`, `payload_overbandwidth`, `payload_depleted`, and `payload_overdue`, enabling post-run analysis of resource strategy versus mission outcomes.

### Datalink & Crew Coordination Implementation Status

- Added `plugins/datalink.py`, echoing NASA CPDLC evaluations showing reduced taxi time and voice congestion when digital messaging is available, yet highlighting situations that still demand rapid response ([NASA TM–2020-0010384](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20200010384/downloads/20200010384.pdf); [NTRS 19890002355](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19890002355)). The plugin displays an ordered queue (ID, channel, priority, remaining time, text) with keyboard navigation (UP/DOWN) and acknowledgement (ENTER) plus scenario hooks:

  ```text
  0:00:05;datalink;start
  0:00:07;datalink;message;MSG1,ATC,PRIO,HOLD SHORT RWY 28,25
  0:00:20;datalink;message;MSG2,UAVOPS,NORM,Update LL track,40
  0:00:35;datalink;forceack;MSG1
  0:01:00;datalink;clear;*
  ```

- Automatically logs `datalink_receive`, `datalink_ack` (with response time), `datalink_miss`, `datalink_drop`, and `datalink_clear`. Overdue feedback flashes when time-to-impact expires, enabling researchers to correlate message density against NASA-TLX/RSME scores in complex crew simulations.

### Energy & G-Envelope Implementation Status

- Added `plugins/energymanager.py`, which sequences high-G events (name, target G, duration), tracks cumulative G-seconds, and decrements an energy reserve to simulate pilot fatigue during high-performance sorties. Scenario commands:
  - `energymanager;event;ENGAGE,5.5,35`
  - `energymanager;overg;6.3`
  - `energymanager;energy;85`
- Logged metrics include `energy_event_schedule`, `energy_event_start`, `energy_event_complete`, `energy_overg`, and `energy_alert` so researchers can align physiological overlays (HRV, visual occlusion) with G-onset profiles.

### Threat Prioritisation & Weapons Timeline Implementation Status

- Added `plugins/threatboard.py`, which lists each airborne threat with its sector, range, weapon hint, and time-to-impact. Scenario commands:
  - `threatboard;spawn;TH1,035,14,R73,45`
  - `threatboard;engage;TH1,FOX3`
  - `threatboard;reprioritize;TH1,010,10`
  - `threatboard;resolve;TH1,SPLASH`
- Metrics emitted (`threat_spawn`, `threat_engage`, `threat_resolve`, `threat_overdue`, `threat_drop`) allow researchers to correlate FOX timing with workload measures. Overdue flashing warns when any threat’s TTI expires unresolved, mirroring cockpit threat board urgency.

## 3. Use Case 2 – High-Performance Aircraft Crews

Fighter and aerobatic pilots juggle extreme G-management, rapid sensor/weapon reconfiguration, and threat triage while coping with physiological load ([Cognitive Workload Analysis of Fighter Aircraft Pilots](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339905636_Cognitive_Workload_Analysis_of_Fighter_Aircraft_Pilots_in_Flight_Simulator_Environment); [Frontiers review on MATB & pilot workload](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/physiology/articles/10.3389/fphys.2024.1408242/full)). To reflect that:

| Module | Goal | Implementation Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Energy & G-Envelope Manager** | Enforce coordinated G-onset schedules, fuel/energy balance, and heat management. | Plugin visualises energy-maneuverability diagrams; joystick input or keyboard commands select bank/pitch rates. Over-G events trigger penalties and overdue alarms. |
| **Threat Prioritisation & Weapons Timeline** | Train rapid reprioritisation of radar/IRS threats, weapon pairing, and “Fox” timelines. | Implemented via `plugins/threatboard.py`, which displays sector, range, weapon hint, and time-to-impact so operators can call FOX within deadlines. |
| **Emergency Stack & Failure Cascades** | Drill hydraulic/electrical failures during high workload. | Scenario engine injects failure events that pause other tasks until a checklist widget (HTML instructions plugin) is satisfied. Track compliance time and residual risk. |
| **Physiological Stress Overlays** | Combine MATB load with hypoxia or high-G cues (e.g., blurred widgets, delayed inputs). | Use scenario parameters to degrade widget brightness or inject lag to emulate tunnel vision; pair with `labstreaminglayer` to tag when overlays are active for neuro/biometric research. |

### HPA Reference Scenario

- Added `includes/scenarios/hpa_overlay.txt`, a three-minute sortie that runs Energy Manager, Threat Board, Datalink, Physio Monitor, and the legacy MATB tasks. It schedules a BFM-like sequence (ENTRY/SETUP/ENGAGE/DEFENSIVE/Egress), injects an over-G excursion, and interleaves CPDLC prompts plus two scripted threats (`TH1`, `TH2`) so researchers can test how fast pilots recover from successive high-G events.

### Testing Flow

1. **Baseline sortie** – run existing MATB core tasks to capture personal baselines.
2. **Incremental overlays** – add Energy Manager + Threat Board while keeping COMM/RESMAN active.
3. **Stress cocktail** – apply visual occlusion or lag modifiers during a combined event storm to observe breakdown thresholds, mirroring findings that high workload plus physiological stress degrade tracking first.

Instrumentation focus: measure time to correct weapon–threat pairing, number of over-G events, recovery timeline adherence, and ability to maintain COMM accuracy while coping with failure cascades.

## 4. Cross-Cutting Enhancements

1. **Scenario Templates & Difficulty Ramps** – Create YAML/CSV templates for “UAS basic,” “UAS BVLOS,” “HPA BFM,” etc., plus a generator that tweaks event rates so researchers can reproduce workloads consistently (aligns with recent MATB standardisation recommendations).
2. **Automation & Solver Hooks** – Extend plugin parameters to expose per-task automation states (e.g., `automaticsolver=True` for autopilot hold, or AI radio assistance) so experiments can toggle mixed-initiative strategies.
3. **Performance Analytics** – Expand `core/logger.py` to summarise mission-level KPIs (mission success %, violation counts) immediately after each scenario and optionally publish over LSL for synchronising with EEG/fNIRS streams.
4. **Human–Machine Interface Fit** – Document joystick and HOTAS bindings for the new plugins (axis reversal already supported in `track` plugin). For UAS payload work, allow mouse + keyboard fallback to keep the software accessible.

## 4.1 Acute HRV Workload Feature

Recent pilot studies show that heart-rate-variability (HRV) indices react fast enough to track workload spikes during flight segments. Increased sympathetic dominance (rising LF power, LF/HF ratio) plus depressed parasympathetic markers (falling RMSSD) aligned with high mental demands in an A320 traffic-pattern experiment, while SDNN captured global variability shifts ([Frontiers Neuroergonomics 2025](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroergonomics/articles/10.3389/fnrgo.2025.1672492/pdf)). A systematic review focused on pilots found RMSSD, SDNN, LF, HF, LF/HF, and pNN50 to be the most frequently reported acute markers in MATB-style paradigms when paired with NASA-TLX or RSME scores ([Detecting and Predicting Pilot Mental Workload Using HRV](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11207491/)).

### Feature Goals

1. Stream ECG-derived R–R intervals into OpenMATB in real time (preferred: `labstreaminglayer` plugin) and compute metrics on rolling windows (e.g., 30 s, 60 s).
2. Surface a compact workload bar that combines z-scored RMSSD (parasympathetic), LF/HF (sympathetic balance), and SDNN (overall variability). Highlight “acute” shifts when consecutive windows breach configurable deltas (e.g., RMSSD drop >15% from personal baseline).
3. Log per-window metrics to `performance` entries so HRV signatures can be replayed alongside MATB task outcomes.

### Implementation Sketch

| Component | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `plugins/physiomonitor.py` | Derive from `AbstractPlugin`. Accept stream metadata (`lsl_stream`, `window_seconds`, `baseline_seconds`). Maintain a deque of NN intervals, compute time-domain (RMSSD, SDNN, pNN50) and frequency-domain metrics (LF, HF, LF/HF) using Welch or Lomb–Scargle. |
| Visualization | Use stacked spark-lines + gauge: RMSSD line (green), LF/HF bar (red if > threshold), textual SDNN. Reuse `taskfeedback` to flash when thresholds exceed “acute” levels. |
| Baseline calibration | At scenario start, collect `baseline_seconds` of data while workload is low; store means to normalise subsequent z-scores. |
| Alerts & Logging | When `rmssd_delta < -delta_rmssd` or `lfhf_delta > delta_lfhf`, emit `performance,hrv,acute_event=1` rows. Provide optional hook to pause or annotate other tasks. |

### Display/Analysis Suggestions

- Overlay HRV panel above Mission Director or Energy Manager widgets so trainees see physiological consequences alongside task load.
- Offer “HRV trend” timeline in debrief: aggregate window metrics, mark MATB events (e.g., COMM prompt) to spot causality.
- Allow export of per-window metrics via CSV or LSL for external analytics (EEG co-analysis, adaptive automation research).

This modular approach keeps acquisition (via LSL) decoupled from visualisation, while aligning with validated HRV markers for acute workload detection.

## 5. Step-by-Step Approach

| Phase | Activities | Deliverables |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Baseline & Instrumentation** | Profile existing tasks, confirm logging formats, add KPI summaries. | Benchmark scenarios + logging spec. |
| **2. UAS Module Build** | Implement Mission Director + Sense-and-Avoid plugins, author starter scenarios, add metrics. | `missiondirector.py`, `senseandavoid.py`, `includes/scenarios/uas_basic.txt`. |
| **3. Payload & Datalink Iteration** | Layer payload manager + datalink task, update instructions and questionnaires. | New plugin classes, updated instructions pack. |
| **4. HPA Module Build** | Deliver Energy/G module and Threat Board, script emergency overlays. | `energy_manager.py`, `threatboard.py`, stress overlay utilities. |
| **5. Validation & Research Packaging** | Run pilot studies, tune difficulty, document reproducible setups, publish README/CHANGELOG updates. | Validation report, updated docs, tagged release. |

## 6. Immediate Next Steps

1. **Decide plugin order** – Confirm whether UAS or HPA modules land first so we can branch scenarios accordingly.
2. **Define metrics** – Finalise KPI list (e.g., “geofence breach seconds,” “over-G frequency”) before coding so logging contracts stay stable.
3. **Prototype UI wireframes** – Rough out widget layouts for Mission Director, Sense-and-Avoid, and Energy Manager to surface any container limitations early.
4. **Plan physiological overlays** – If hypoxia/high-G effects are required, align with hardware (e.g., dimming filters, input lag) so scenario designers can flip them via config only.

This plan keeps documentation centralised, ties new features to existing extension seams, and aligns with published research so the new modules remain defensible for both experimental and training communities. Implementation credit: **Dr Diego Malpica, Aerospace Medicine**.
