| The Multi-Attribute Task Battery (MATB) has been a keystone for research investigating workload, trust in automation, and other cognitive research since its inception in the early 1990's. To facilitate continued use in research today, the United States Air Force took steps to ensure that the task would continue to remain relevant, developing its own version, AF\_MATB. This version preserves all of the features and appearance of the original, in addition to implementing new features aimed at aiding the researcher: AF\_MATB includes utilities to customize task parameters and generate scripts in an automated fashion, as well as a detailed performance log at the end of every run. |                                                                                                        |                     |                                 |                                           |

# 1.0 INTRODUCTION

The original MATB was developed by J. Raymond Comstock and Ruth J. Arnegard in 1992. Originally designed as a benchmark for a wide range of studies regarding operator performance and workload (Arnegard &#x26; Comstock, 1991), it has become a mainstay for psychological and psychophysiological research regarding cognitive workload, as well as the issue of trust in automation (Carmody &#x26; Gluckman, 1993; Parasuraman, Mouloua, &#x26; Hilburn, 1998), and psychophysiologically-controlled aiding (Wilson, Lambert, &#x26; Russell, 2000).

With changes in computer hardware over the last 18 years, the original MATB software has become all but unusable on modern systems. In order to facilitate compatibility on newer computer systems in government and educational laboratories, additional hardware and software support was necessary. Due to MATB’s widespread use in research, the ability to customize the task to suit specific research areas was also added, allowing MATB to cater to an even larger research community. In conjunction with this, more detailed performance analyses were also added, as well as the ability to quickly create and customize experimental scripts to again suit the specific needs of researchers. The result of these additions is AF_MATB, which can be executed from any Windows PC. This new version of the original MATB preserves all of the design features of the previous version, while implementing a number of new features designed to provide maximum flexibility and customizability while improving ease-of-use for the researcher and participant. The new features do not impact comparisons with the previous software; exact replications of previous research are possible and facilitated by the new supporting tools.

Like the original version, AF_MATB consists of six windows that comprise the total battery. Each of the four subtasks is represented in a separate window (see Figure 001); these subtasks include: System Monitoring, Communications, Resource Management, and Tracking. The last two windows, which contain Scheduling and the Pump Status information, are resources that the user can utilize to improve performance during the task. Each of these windows will be discussed later in more detail.

# 2.0 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Hardware requirements for AF_MATB include a 1 GB of RAM, 2 GHz dual-core processor, a keyboard, mouse, joystick, and a 15-inch monitor (1280x1024 resolution), at minimum. It is important that these minimum requirements be met to ensure proper function of the task. Executing the task on machines that do not meet these minimum requirements may produce periods of freezing caused by audio playback, slower movement of the fuel level indicators, gauge indicators, and tracking crosshair, as well as unreliability of event times. Please note that while the task is sensitive to machines that do not meet the minimum requirements, movement in the task and playback of audio files will not be negatively affected in any way by machines that exceed these requirements.

A keyboard, mouse and joystick are all required for the task to be properly executed. A mouse is necessary for responding to some of the dialog boxes at the start of the task, and can be used by the subject to respond to events in the task. The keyboard is necessary for manual event triggering and AF_MATB System Commands, which will be discussed later. Finally, the joystick is required for operation of the Tracking Task. In the event that a joystick is not present, the user will be notified that no joystick has been detected at the start of the task and the tracking crosshair will float freely about the screen. Please be aware that the joystick must be connected to the computer prior to execution of the task. If the joystick is connected after the task has been executed, the joystick will not be detected.

AF_MATB was designed for Windows computers operating on Windows XP SP3 or higher. If the task is executed using a MATLAB script, then version 2007B or later should be used. Otherwise, MATLAB Compiler Runtime 7.8 or later is required.

Please ensure that your DPI settings are set to default values. If your DPI is set to custom values, you may experience window distortion.

# 3.0 AF_MATB Subtask Descriptions

# 3.1. System Monitoring

The System Monitoring subtask (see Figure 002) can be located in the upper left section of the AF_MATB window. It consists of two tasks: Gauges and Lights. The length of event faults can be manipulated using AF_MATB_Parameters, which will be discussed later in this manual. Please note that the performance and operating parameters for each of the two tasks are independent. For example, the Gauges and Lights components are each capable of having different timeouts.

# 3.1.1. Gauges

The Gauges subtask consists of the user observing the four gauges located in the System Monitoring window of AF_MATB (see Figure 003). The user must be informed of the normal operating behavior of the gauges, as well as behavior that would indicate a malfunction. The user is instructed that in event of a malfunction, a correct response is required within the experimenter-defined timeframe.

Normal operating behavior for a gauge is defined as a gauge indicator smoothly fluctuating between one tick mark above the center of the gauge and one tick mark below the center of the gauge (see Figure 004). The gauge indicator may briefly pause at the top of its operating range before changing direction and moving towards the bottom of its operating range, or vice versa. The length of this pause is capable of being adjusted via the End of Range Delay Max (Cycles) parameter. Gauge speed can also be adjusted through the Gauge Speed Lower and Higher limit parameters.

Distribution A: Approved for public release; distribution unlimited.
---


The two images above illustrate the maximum and minimum value of each gauge when operating normally, respectively.

A gauge malfunction is defined as any time when the gauge indicator fluctuates outside of the previously defined operating range. This behavior will be exhibited for the duration specified by the Gauge Malfunction Timeout.

A gauge malfunction is characterized by a smooth transition out of the normal operating range and into either the upper or lower malfunctioning ranges. For the duration of the malfunction, the indicator will continuously alternate between the malfunctioning range and the normal range, as illustrated in Figure 005. The program is designed such that the scheduled malfunctions will occur in the area that the indicator is already traveling within. For instance, if the indicator is traveling up when the malfunction is scheduled to occur, the indicator will stay in the upper malfunctioning range. Conversely, if the indicator is traveling down when the malfunction is scheduled to occur, the indicator will stay in the lower malfunctioning range. The two sets of figures above (Figure 005) illustrate the minimum and maximum points of the malfunctioning range that can occur in the lower portion and upper portion of the gauge, respectively.

Figure 005a         Figure 005b

Figure 005 – The minimum and maximum points of the indicator during a malfunction for the lower and upper portion of the gauge.

Responses for this task can be recorded in one of two ways. Users may respond using the keyboard command for each gauge (see Keyboard Response Commands for System Monitoring), or users may respond by clicking on the corresponding button below each gauge, i.e. F1, F2, etc. in the task window with the mouse. Please note that specific response modes may be enabled or disabled via Input Options.

If the appropriate response is recorded within the malfunction duration, the gauge indicator will automatically return to the center of the gauge, and stay there for a specified duration (Correct Fault Identification). Additionally, a yellow bar will appear at the bottom of the gauge, as illustrated (Figure 006).

Distribution A: Approved for public release; distribution unlimited.

# Figure 006 – A gauge with a malfunction that was properly corrected.

If no response is recorded within the malfunction duration, or if a response is recorded after the timeframe, it will be recorded as a timed-out response and a false alarm respectively. In the event that a response is not made in the correct timeframe, the gauge indicators will automatically resume normal functioning with no indication that a malfunction occurred.

Distribution A: Approved for public release; distribution unlimited.

# 3.1.2. Lights

The Lights subtask consists of the user observing two indicator lights located in the System Monitoring window of AF_MATB.

Figure 007 – The Lights portion of the System Monitoring subtask with both lights shown to be functioning normally.

In the event of a malfunction, each light exhibits different malfunctioning behavior, though the duration of the malfunction that either light exhibits will be the same. The duration of the malfunction can be manipulated via the Gauge Malfunction Timeout parameter.

Malfunctioning behavior that requires a user response for Light 1 is when the light “turns off” or turns black. For Light 2, malfunctioning behavior that requires a user response is when the light “turns on” or turns red. Each of these lights will malfunction for a set duration, as previously mentioned. The figure below (Figure 008) illustrates the malfunction for each light. Thus, if the user were to encounter the situation below, responses would be required for each light, as a malfunction has occurred for both Light 1 and Light 2.

Figure 008 – The Lights portion of the Systems Monitoring subtask with both lights malfunctioning.

Responses for this task can be recorded in one of two ways. Users may respond using the keyboard command for each light (see Keyboard Response Commands for System Monitoring), or users may respond via the corresponding button below each light, i.e. F5 or F6 in the task window. Please note that specific response modes may be enabled or disabled via Input Options.

Distribution A: Approved for public release; distribution unlimited.
---
If the appropriate response is recorded within the malfunction duration, the malfunctioning behavior will automatically be corrected, and the light will be restored to its normal functioning behavior.

If no response is recorded within the malfunction duration, or if a response is recorded after the timeframe, it will be recorded as a timed-out response or a timed-out response and a false alarm, respectively. In the event that a response is not made in the correct timeframe, the lights will automatically resume their normal functioning behavior.

# 3.2. Resource Management

The Resource Management task is located in the bottom-middle section of the AF_MATB window. The goal of this task is to balance and maintain the two consumption tanks (Tank A and Tank B) at a specific volume using the eight pumps and four supply tanks. There are several parameters that can be manipulated through the Task Parameters Utility. These parameters include: the target volume, pump flow rates, tank starting volumes, and the maximum tank volumes. The amount of time that passes between updates of tank information can be manipulated through the Task Parameters Utility.

Please note that the window to the right of the Resource Management is the Pump Status Window (see Figure 009). This window is used to provide additional information regarding the pumps in the Resource Management task. It indicates which pumps are active by displaying the flow rate of each particular pump when it is on. In one of the autopilot options, all pump rates are replaced with “Auto,” indicating that the fuel autopilot is active. The Pump Status Window is only meant to be used as a resource and requires no action on the part of the user.

| RESOURCE MANAGEMENT | PUMP STATUS |            |      |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---- |
| A                   | B           | Flow Rates |      |
| 2409                | 2409        | 1          | 1800 |
| 1189                | 1189        | 2          | 1600 |
|                     |             | 3          | 1800 |
|                     |             | 4          | 1600 |
|                     |             | 5          | 1600 |
|                     |             | 6          | 1600 |
|                     |             | 7          |      |

Figure 009 – The Resource Management and Pump Status windows of AF_MATB, with Pumps 1 through 6 on.

Tank A can be filled using three methods. The first way that fuel can be pumped into Tank A is through Tank C, via Pump 1. However, Tank C is not a bottomless tank, and must be filled from the bottomless supply tank to right of Tank C via Pump 5. The second way that fuel can be pumped in is directly from the bottomless tank via Pump 2. The third and final way fuel can be pumped into Tank A is from Tank B via Pump 8. This is a viable solution in the event that Tank B is over-filled while Tank A is under-filled or if Pumps 1, 2, or 5 are disabled for extended periods. However, it should be noted that this solution is not recommended except in specific cases due to the fact that, in most cases, it will still hurt one’s Resource Management score.

Distribution A: Approved for public release; distribution unlimited.
---

Tank B can also be filled using three methods. The first way that fuel can be pumped into Tank B is through Tank D, via Pump 3. However, Tank D is not a bottomless tank, and must be filled from the bottomless supply tank to the right of Tank C via Pump 6. The second way that fuel can be pumped in is directly from the bottomless tank via Pump 4. The third and final way fuel can be pumped into Tank B is from Tank A via Pump 7. As with transfers from B to A, this is a viable solution in the event that Tank A is over-filled while Tank B is under-filled or if Pumps 3, 4, or 6 are disabled for extended periods.

Pumps used in this task are toggled on and off, and this can be done in two ways. It can be done by pressing the corresponding number, i.e. 1 for Pump 1, etc. on the keyboard, or by mouse-clicking the small square in between two tanks. Squares that are black are considered “off” and are not pumping fuel, while boxes that are green are considered “on” and are pumping fuel.

The Resource Management subtask can experience two types of malfunctions or faults. The first type of fault is known as a Shut-off. In a Shut-off, a specific pump will turn off automatically with no notification that it is going to be turned off. In essence, a Shut-off simulates a user manually turning the pump off.

The second type of fault is a Pump Failure. In a Failure, the affected pump is turned off and locked (see Figure 010), such that the user will not be able to use that pump for a specified duration, which can be set via the Pump Fault Duration parameter. Please note that while it is not recommended for experimental conditions, the user can correct Pump Failures if the Allow Subject to Manually Fix Pumps? parameter is enabled.

Figure 010 – The Resource Management and Pump Status windows illustrating a Pump 1 fault.

Pump Failures are indicated by the pump turning red for the specified duration of the event, as illustrated by Pump 1 in Figure 010. In addition, please note that within the Pump Status window, the flow rate for Pump 1 is 0, which indicates that no fuel is flowing through that pump.

Distribution A: Approved for public release; distribution unlimited.
---


At the end of the Failure duration, the pump will turn black, and normal function will be restored.

It should be noted that one of the new features of AF_MATB is an autopilot mode for the Resource Management subtask. This subtask is now one of two subtasks in AF_MATB that has an autopilot mode which can be enabled or disabled by either the script or the user. When the autopilot is engaged, the user’s ability to manipulate pumps is disabled, and the computer will manage exactly which pumps should be on and off based on the Autopilot Maximum Difference Between Tanks, Lower and Upper Limit Main Tank Autopilot Ranges, and Lower and Upper Limit Supply Tank Autopilot Ranges. When a specific tank falls above or below one of these parameters, the autopilot will direct the correct pump to take the appropriate action.

There are two different modes that this autopilot can operate under. In the first mode, there is no indication that the Resource Management autopilot is on. There are no labels or notifications that it is active, except for the fact that pumps will change without any action from the user. Additionally, the user’s actions are locked out while the autopilot is engaged.

The other mode, as illustrated in Figure 011, uses a less distracting approach. In this case, the autopilot hides all of its actions by turning all of the pumps blue and setting all Pump Status flow rates to “Auto.” This form of autopilot was created after users reported being distracted by the changes occurring in the Resource Management window while the autopilot was active. It should be noted that, using this method, the user’s actions are still locked out when the autopilot is engaged.

# 3.3. Tracking

Located in the middle upper portion of the Task Window, is the Tracking task. This subtask is the only subtask that does not have dual input. Using a joystick, the goal is to take the green crosshair and steer it as close to the center yellow crosshair as possible. Tracking has 3 difficulties, each of which can be triggered via the user or script. Each difficulty is marked by more frequent changes in direction and faster movement of the tracking crosshair.

This subtask is the only subtask, besides the Resource Management task, that includes an autopilot mode. When this autopilot mode is enabled, the “MANUAL” label (Figure 012) on the task will change to “AUTOMATIC” (Figure 013). Additionally, the tracking crosshair will move to the center crosshairs and stay there. During this time, no input from the joystick is required. This mode can be activated via the user or script, as well.

# 3.4. Communications

The Communications Subtask is an aural subtask located in the lower left portion of the Task Window. This task centers around 2 stimuli: True Communications Events and False Communication Events. True Events are addressed to the user’s callsign designated by the blue “Callsign” label in the Communications Window (Figure 014). False Events are addressed to any callsign other than the one indicated in the Communications Window.

# COMMUNICATIONS

Callsign: NGT504

Figure 014 – The Communications subtask window with the default maximum and minimum frequencies shown for the NAV channels and default minimum and maximum frequencies for the COM channels.

True Events have a specified time-out associated with them. In order to successfully respond to a True Event, the user must follow the instructions issued and change the specified channel to the correct frequency. The four channels in the Communications window are the column on the left, labeled as “NAV1,” “NAV2,” “COM1,” and “COM2” by default. The frequencies of each of those corresponding channels are located to the right of each channel.

Distribution A: Approved for public release; distribution unlimited.
---
An example of a True Event is as follows: “NGT504, NGT504, set first navigation one zero nine point seven.” “First navigation” refers to the channel, NAV1, and “one zero nine point seven” refers to the frequency, 109.7. In order to properly respond, the arrow indicators need to be located on the appropriate channel, in this case, NAV1. In order to do this, the user can use the corresponding arrow keys on the keyboard, or the user can click on the corresponding arrow in the Task Window. Next, the correct frequency should be selected using either the keyboard or Task Window arrows. Finally, while the arrows are still on the appropriate channel, the user needs to lock in that frequency using either the Enter key on the keyboard or the “Enter” button on the Task Window. The “Enter” button will briefly change from blue to green once it has been pressed; this allows the user to verify that his/her response was locked-in (Figure 015). Please note that whatever channel and frequency the arrows are on when Enter is pressed is the information that will be locked in.

# COMMUNICATIONS

| Callsign NGT504 |       |   |
| --------------- | ----- | - |
| NAV1            | 108.9 |   |
| NAV2            | 108.9 |   |
| ↓↑ COM1         | 121.5 | - |

|                 | Enter |   |

Figure 015 – The Communications subtask where someone just locked in frequency 121.5 on channel COM1, as indexed by the green enter button.

In the example above, the user has successfully locked in a frequency of 121.5 for the Com1 Channel. Please note, as previously stated, you can only lock in frequencies on the channel that the arrows were on at the time Enter or “Enter” was pressed.

Parameters that can be manipulated via AF_MATB_Parameters for this subtask include the channel labels, the True Event timeout, the channel frequency ranges, and the duration of the locked-in indicator.

# 3.5. Scheduling

The Scheduling Window is located in the upper right portion of the Task Window. This window allows the user to see eight minutes into the future for the Tracking and Communications subtasks. When scheduling is disabled, or when a script is not loaded, the scheduling window will appear with two thin yellow lines, as illustrated in Figure 016.

For the Tracking subtask, the color and thickness of the line on the left, the “T” line, indicates different levels of tracking difficulty. For the Communications subtask, every communication event, regardless of whether it is a True Comm, or a False Comm, is signified by a small red rectangle on the right yellow line, or “C” timeline.

The use of this window may or may not be desired for some experimental paradigms, and as a result, it can be enabled or disabled through Enable Scheduling? parameter. This window requires no action on the part of the user (see Figure 017).

# SCHEDULING

Figure 017 – A Scheduling window with a 5-minute trial set to a low Tracking difficulty, and 8 Communications events.

In this Scheduling window (Figure 017), the thicker green section on the “T” line indicates that for the next 5 minutes, the Tracking Difficulty is set to “Low.” Additionally, note the red rectangles on the “C” line. They indicate that in the next five minutes, eight communications will occur. As time progresses, the green bar will get shorter, indicating the progression of time, and the red rectangles will move closer to the top. Once they reach the top, they will disappear. A Scheduling window with a thicker yellow section indicates a moderate Tracking Difficulty (Figure 018). Also, note the increase in red rectangles on the Communications timeline.

The Scheduling window is able to handle all trial conditions input via a script. In this instance (Figure 021), a six minute script was loaded, with three trials of two minutes each. In the first two minutes, the Tracking Difficulty was set to “Low,” while the second 2 minutes, minutes 2:00 – 4:00 were set to autopilot, and finally, minutes 4:00 – 6:00 were set to “High.”

The visible bar will either grow to indicate its full duration (the green bar now indicates that the next trial is 5 minutes long, as opposed to the previous figure, when it could only indicate up to 3 minutes). Once the last bar on the timeline grows to indicate its true duration, it will start to move up the timeline as the bar before it continues to shrink.

This folder is what AF_MATB will ask for after inputting the Subject ID and script information (see Figure 030). All that is left is to copy the three .exe files into the directory that the System Files folder is located in and execute (see Figure 031). The System Files folder should not be modified, nor should anything be.

# 4.2.2. Resource Management

The first pump can be toggled on or off using either the corresponding keyboard command (in this example, the number 1 key) or by clicking on that pump with the mouse (see Figure 033a). The direction of flow from this pump, as denoted by the arrow next to that pump, indicates that fuel is flowing from Tank C to Tank A at the rate indicated by the Pump Status Window.

Please be aware that all pumps in the Resource Management subtask are capable of being toggled on or off using either the keyboard command, or by clicking on the pump with the mouse. In addition, no pump will be able to be turned on if fuel is unable to flow from it. Finally, any pump that is experiencing a fault, as indicated by being red as opposed to black or green, will not pump fuel and will be stuck in the “Off” position for the specified fault duration. These three pieces of information are true for all pumps in the Resource Management subtask. Please note that the items that comprise Figure 033 are buttons in the task.

# Figure 033a

The direction of flow from this pump, as denoted by the arrow next to that that pump, indicates that the fuel is flowing from an unlabeled supply tank to Tank A at the rate indicated by the Pump Status Window (see Figure 033b).

Users can click on the pump icon in the task window (the green squares in the examples) using the mouse, instead of the keys on the keyboard.

# 4.2.3. Communications

Please note that the five items that comprise Figure 034 under each of the five keyboard commands for the Communications Subtask correspond with that keyboard command. The first four of these are not buttons, however, but clickable images. Click on the arrow in the task window, to perform the corresponding action.

- → (Right Arrow Key)

Will increase the frequency of the channel that the arrows are currently on by the increment defined in the Task Parameters Utility. If the maximum frequency for that channel is reached, then the frequency will wrap around and start over from the minimum frequency (see Figure 034a).
- # Figure 034a

← (Left Arrow Key)

Will decrease the frequency of the channel that the arrows are currently on by the increment defined in the Task Parameters Utility. If the minimum frequency for that channel is reached, then the frequency will wrap around and start over from the maximum frequency (see Figure 034b).
- # Figure 034b

↑ (Up Arrow Key)

Allow the experimenter to select the channel they would like to manipulate. Pressing this key will move the arrows towards the top communication channel. If the first communication channel is selected and this arrow is pressed, the arrows will wrap around to the bottom and the fourth channel will then be selected (see Figure 034c).

Allow the experimenter to select the channel they would like to manipulate. Pressing this key will move the arrows towards the bottom communication channel. If the bottom communication channel is selected and this arrow is pressed, the arrows will wrap around to the top and the first channel will then be selected (see Figure 034d).

# Figure 034d

Enter

Locks in the frequency of the currently selected channel. Whichever channel is currently selected, as indicated by the location of the arrows, will be the channel and frequency that are recorded. The Enter button in the task will turn green for a short time (time configurable using the Task Parameters Utility), confirming that the frequency has been locked-in (see Figure 034e).

Space

Designed to start the experiment. When a trial or practice run is ready to be started, pressing the space bar will trigger a countdown to start the task. This key will only respond if the task is in a “ready” state. The below figure (Figure 035) illustrates the countdown timer at the start of the program.

# Figure 035 – The AF_MATB window after pressing Space.

After pressing start, a five-second timer will appear in the upper left portion of the task window, below the gauges, regardless of whether Display Date and Time? is enabled. The timer is located at the bottom of the System Monitoring window. When the timer expires, the task will begin normal functioning. This countdown timer was added for experimental purposes to allow the system timer to ramp up and for data collection to be better coordinated.

Distribution A: Approved for public release; distribution unlimited.

Esc (Escape)

Designed to stop or restart the experiment. Pressing the escape key once will stop the trial or practice. Once stopped, the current trial/experiment cannot be resumed. At this point, the task is in a “suspended” state, as indexed by the red “Stopped.” (Please note that if the date and timer have been disabled via the Display Date and Time? parameter, then “Stopped” will not appear.)

Figure 036 shows an example of a practice that has been stopped and is now in the “suspended” state. However, if the date and time are disabled, “Stopped” or “Paused” will not appear below the System Monitoring window when the task is stopped or paused. Figure 037 illustrates the absence of the date and timer, as well as other indicators like “Paused” or “Stopped”.

Pressing the escape key a second time will reset the entire task and restore it to a “ready” state. At this point, one can simply restart the trial/practice, or load a new one. The “ready” state is indexed by the yellow color of timer on the task (if visible). PLEASE NOTE: All performance data from the previous run will be erased once the task has gone from a “suspended” to “ready” state. If you would like a copy of the data before it is erased, make sure to copy the data folder to another directory before bringing the task back to a “ready” state.

The figure above (Figure 038) shows an example of the previously illustrated practice going from a suspended state to a “ready” state.

# Pause | Break

If this option is enabled, it will allow for suspension of the task, practice, and all processes associated with the task for that particular run. Pressing the Pause key once will suspend the processes of the task. The “paused” state is indexed by a green color of the timer on the task. Pressing this key again will resume all processes from the exact point at which they were left and will also restore the timer to its normal, yellow color.

Please note that if the Enable Pausing? parameter is disabled, then pressing this button will do nothing. Also, please note that if the Display Date and Time? parameter is disabled, then the green “Paused” text in the task window will not appear, and the task will appear frozen, just as it does when the Display Date and Time? parameter is disabled and an individual presses Esc (Escape) (see Figure 039).

The “New Load” button. During a run, a paused state, or a ready state, pressing this button will prompt a load screen and allow the user to select a new script (see Figure 040). Loading a new script will delete and replace all previous data, so this should not be used if your goal is to acquire performance data from multiple runs. However, if the goal is to expose the user to many different scenarios in short succession, such as for training purposes, this key will work well.

# 4.4. Event-Related Commands

# 4.4.1. Transition Logging

Allows the user to indicate precisely when they feel that the difficulty of the task has changed. Pressing the „Q‟ key on the keyboard records the timestamp, as well as the previous and current trials. This data is output into a file that also contains a list of all of the actual trial transitions in a given script, so that the comparison between the user‟s perceptions and the actual, programmed task difficulty can be made quickly.

If this key is pressed and no actual script is present, then AF_MATB will log the action in the Master Event Log and nowhere else.

# 5.0 RUNNING AF_MATB

When AF_MATB is executed, the first thing the task will ask for is a Subject ID. This will be included in the name of the folder that contains all of the performance files, as well as all performance files, themselves. AF_MATB will automatically read filenames and check to make sure that no invalid characters are entered. Press OK or the Enter key to submit your Subject ID (see Figure 043).

Please note that the user may want to include run information here as well. For example, instead of using “S01” as the Subject ID, you may want to put use “S01_R01,” indicating that this is the first run for S01. This will make identification of Performance files easier.

After entering a valid Subject ID, AF_MATB will then determine if the information loaded into the task was loaded by clicking any of the …Continue to AF_MATB buttons in AF_MATB_Parameters or AF_MATB_ScriptGenerator.

| Subject ID                              | ×      |
| --------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Please Enter a Valid Subject Identifier |        |

Figure 043 – The first dialog box you will see when executing AF_MATB, the Subject ID dialog.

In the below figure (Figure 044), information was loaded directly from AF_MATB_Parameters. As a result, the task will verify that the user still does not want to load a script file into the program. Please note that loading scripts that were not constructed using custom parameters may result in unstable task behavior and is not recommended. It is best to load a script designed using those custom parameters by using the AF_MATB_ScriptGenerator.

Figure 045 gives an example of the message that will be displayed when information is loaded directly from AF_MATB_ScriptGenerator. Once this message is acknowledged, you will be asked to load the AF_MATB System Files folder, which will be discussed later.

In the event that no information was directly loaded into the task, AF_MATB will recognize that no files have been loaded and still give the user the opportunity to do so. At this stage, AF_MATB can execute in one of two modes, either using a script or running freely. In order to train subjects on the task, it may be beneficial to first run the task in free-mode which will allow them to get a feel for the task, in general.

Figure 046 is an example of the message the user will receive if no script files have been loaded. If the user would like to operate in free-mode, instead of the scripted-mode, the user should simply choose “No” when this message appears. If the user answers “No,” then they will be asked to identify where the AF_MATB System Files directory is located. This step will be covered in more detail in and is illustrated in Figure 050. If the user answers “Yes,” they will be asked to select a script using the file selection utility.

# Loading Task Parameters or Script File

If the experimenter indicates that they would like to load a task parameters or script file, the message above (Figure 047) will follow, which asks the user to choose what information they would like to load. Users have the option of loading a task parameters file, a script file, without any custom task parameters, or the entire script file, including event times and custom task parameters.

As previously stated, this folder is critical to proper task operation and should not be modified in any way. Please refer to the figure below (Figure 050) for an example of how to use the directory selection tool. Simply click on the System Files folder and press “OK.” The user should see “AF_MATB System Files” in the “Folder:” field in the window.

# 5.1. Performance Folder Structure

Performance folders for an AF_MATB run are located in the directory from which the task was executed. In the folder, a run is broken down by trials. In AF_MATB, a run is defined as a session beginning when Space is pressed and ending when the “Saving In Progress” window appears and then disposes. Each run will generate a performance folder in the executing or current directory. However, in each performance folder, there may be multiple folders, as each run may be composed of multiple trials. A trial is defined as a Low, Moderate, High Difficulty, or Transition Stage in the Script Generator. Every line in the Condition List of the Script Generator signifies a trial, and as such, AF_MATB will parse performance and raw data by each trial. The task will also generate performance data across all trials and that data will be recorded in a Transition log and in a Master Event log. A digital copy of the raw performance will be generated as well, which can be used to go back and split performance into even smaller time series.

Figure 053 is an example of a performance folder. Please note that the performance folder was manually dragged into a folder called Performance; the performance folder was originally located in C:\Documents and Settings\millerwd\My Documents\AF_MATB.

Figure 053 – An example performance folder generated after an experimental run. Also note that in addition to the Subject ID, “Alpha,” a date and time stamp was appended to the end of the Subject ID. This was a safety precaution implemented to prevent data loss or overwriting. In this case, no run information was added to the Subject ID, so you would assume that this performance file is the only performance file for Participant Alpha.

The figure below (Figure 054) displays the contents of the performance folder from the previous example. In this example, it is evident that there were two trials in this run. Note the four files not in folders. These files contain data for the entire run, and as such, were left in the root of the performance folder; they were not organized into one of the trial folders.

Figure 054 – The contents of the performance folder generated in Figure 053.

In addition to the four files in the root of the performance folder, there are a total of nine files in each trial folder. Each of these nine files contains different information about user performance on the task.

Below (Figure 055) is an example of all the files that are in a trial folder. Each file’s name contains the Subject ID, followed by the file description, and finally, a number. The number is used to signify the trial that this file is for, in case multiple trials’ performance files are mixed together. Thus, for a file from Trial_1, the end of the filename would be “_1.res,” while the same file from Trial_2 would be “_2.res.”

Figure 055 – The contents of one of the Trial folders illustrated in Figure 054.

In regards to file formats, all files in an experimental run are in one of two formats. For each experimental run, there will be one .mat file, which is the file that contains digital raw data for post processing, and a number of .res files. These .res files, the number of which will vary based on the number of trials in a run, can be opened using any text editor or using Excel. In order to determine exactly how many .res files a run will produce, multiply the number of trials by nine and then add three.

# 5.2. Performance File Descriptions

Figure 055 on the previous page, provided examples of the performance files one would find in a folder. The information in the following pages will name each file, identify its purpose and describe what data it contains.

# 5.2.1. Master Event Log

Contains all of the actions performed by the user as well as any scripted action the task carried out. This file is the only file that is generated regardless of whether a script file is loaded or not.

Specifically, the Master Event Log contains the Event Time, the Task or Item, and the Action that occurred. The Task or Item explains what subtask or component an action was applied to, and the Action describes exactly what behavior was performed.

# 5.2.2. Transition Log

Many of the runs in AF_MATB will be scripted to run several trials, each having a different level of difficulty. The purpose of the Transition Log is to record the types of trials contained in each run and to note the time that each trial begins and ends. The Transition Log is also set up to record the user’s responses to perceived changes in the task’s difficulty (which they designate by pressing the Q key). Thus, the Transition Log makes it possible for the researcher to compare the actual changes in task difficulty with the changes the user perceived.

The information in the log includes: each trial’s level of difficulty, the time that each trial began and ended, and the difficulty of the trial that came before it. Additionally, there is a column called “Perceived or Actual Transitions.” If the information is labeled “Actual,” then it refers to a scripted transition, and if it is labeled “Perceived,” then it refers to an instance when the user perceived a change in task difficulty.

Distribution A: Approved for public release; distribution unlimited.


---
# 5.2.3. Communication Log

Logs all of the possibly correct actions the user makes in regards to the Communications Task.

Specifically, the Communication Log contains the Event Time that an auditory communication was played, its Correct Channel and Correct Frequency, and its Target Signal, which describes whether the communication was a true communication (1) or a false communication (0). It also includes any Timeouts that occur, which are responses made outside of the timeframe designated for a given communication signal. Finally, when the user responds to a communication, the Communication Log also records the Response Time, the Response Channel, and the Response Frequency.

# 5.2.4. Correct Gauge Responses

Logs all of the instances when the user correctly identifies a gauge fault in System Monitoring subtask.

Specifically, it contains the Event Time, the Response Time, the number of the gauge that the individual correctly identified as malfunctioning, and the Event Timeout, or time at which the gauge was automatically restored to normal functioning.

# 5.2.5. Correct Light Responses

Logs all of the correct light fault identifications for the Light component of the System Monitoring subtask.

Specifically, it contains the Event Time, the Response Time, the number of the light that the individual correctly identified as malfunctioning, and the Event Timeout, or time at which the light was automatically restored to normal functioning.

# 5.2.6. Fuel Tank Values

Logs all of the Fuel values for Tanks A and B for each trial. Values are logged at the rate which the task cycles in the computer, approximately every .1 seconds.

Specifically, it contains the Fuel Target, which is the target value for the tanks. This is provided because it can either be a default value or custom parameter and is required for manual calculation of the RMS. Furthermore, the log contains the Event Time, which is the time that information was logged, and the tank volumes, referred to as Tank A Value and Tank B Value. Finally, this file contains the calculations used to determine the Resource Management RMS, including the Tank A Difference and Tank B Difference, or the difference between those tanks and the Fuel Target, as well as the Tank A Deviation and Tank B Deviation, which are the squares of the Tank A and Tank B Differences, respectively.
---
# 5.2.7. Incorrect Communication Log

Logs all clearly incorrect actions the user makes in regards to the Communications Task for each trial.

Specifically, this log contains the Response Time when the incorrect response to a communication was made, as well as the Channel and Frequency used in the response.

# 5.2.8. Incorrect Gauge Responses

Logs all incorrect actions the user makes in regards to the Gauge component of the System Monitoring subtask for each trial.

Specifically, this log contains the Response Time and Gauge Number for each incorrect response.

# 5.2.9. Incorrect Light Responses

Logs all incorrect actions the user makes in regards to the Light component of the System Monitoring subtask for each trial.

Specifically, it contains the Response Time and Light Number for each incorrect response.

# 5.2.10. Tracking Coordinate Log

Logs all of the Tracking values for each trial. Values are logged at the rate which the task cycles, approximately every .1 seconds.

Specifically, this log contains the Center Coordinate, which is the X and Y pixel values for the center of the Tracking task. The Center Coordinate is used by AF_MATB to calculate the Tracking RMS and is provided for manual calculation if needed. Furthermore, it contains the Event Time, or logged time, that the X Coordinate and Y Coordinate pixel locations on the tracking crosshair were taken. Finally, it contains the calculations involved to determine the Tracking RMS, such as the X-Axis Difference and Y-Axis Difference from the X Coordinate and Y Coordinate of the tracking crosshair, respectively, as well as the X-Axis Deviation and Y-Axis Deviation, which are the squares of the X-Axis and Y-Axis Difference, respectively.

# 5.2.11. Performance Summary

Contains condensed performance numbers for all of the subtasks for MATB.

System Monitoring performance metrics for System Monitoring include event occurrences, correct responses, timed-out events, and incorrect responses (or false alarms). In addition, the mean and standard deviation of the reaction time of correct response are also provided. These metrics are broken down on several levels: the individual component level, such as the information for Gauge 1, the

# Resource Management

Resource Management performance can be obtained by taking the RMS error from Tank A and summing that value with the RMS error of Tank B to get a total subtask metric. The RMS error involves two key parameters, the RMS Target Value, which specifies the target volume that the user should try to maintain in both Tanks A and B, and the RMS Interval, specifies the interval at which the tank volumes should be stored so that the task RMS Error can be calculated.

# Tracking

Tracking performance is also obtained by taking the RMS error from the center of the task window.

# Communications

Communications performance is based simply on event occurrences.

The Total Communications metric looks at the total number of all communication signals played during a given trial, and is comprised of the sum of True Communications and False Communications.

The True Communications metric looks at the number of all communication signals addressed to the user’s callsign during a given trial.

The False Communications metric looks at the number of all communication signals addressed to any callsign other than the callsign designated to the user.

The Correct Responses metric tells the experimenter the number of true communication signals that the user responded to correctly (with the correct channel and frequency).

The False Alarms metric tells the experimenter the number of false communication signals to which the user responded to with the correct channel and correct frequency.

Response Timeouts tell the experimenter the number of true communication signals that the user failed to respond to.

True Accuracy Errors look at the number of true communication signals that the user responded to with either the correct channel or correct frequency properly locked-in, but not both.

False Accuracy Errors look at the number of false communication signals that the user responded to with either the correct channel or correct frequency properly locked-in, but not both.

Distribution A: Approved for public release; distribution unlimited.


---
Unexplained Responses are described as user responses where both a frequency and channel were incorrectly locked-in, among other conditions in which the computer cannot account for a user’s actions.

No Event Responses are when a frequency and channel were locked in when no communication signals were played during the task.

The Mean Correct Response Time is the average time it took for a user to correctly respond to the true communication signals.

The STD Correct Response Time is the standard deviation associated with the Mean Correct Response Time.

# 6.0 AF_MATB PARAMETERS

One of the key points to AF_MATB is the fact that virtually every parameter used in the task can be manipulated to suit the experimenter. With this version, experimenters are afforded full control over virtually any and all options they may want to manipulate to suit their needs. In order to manipulate these parameters, a separate GUI was created, AF_MATB_Parameters, to gives the experimenter access to fifty task parameters in a user-friendly form to ensure ease of use, speed, and maximum functionality.

The parameters in AF_MATB can be divided into two important classes; script-critical parameters and operating-task parameters. Script-critical parameters are parameters that the Script Generator (known as AF_MATB_ScriptGenerator, discussed later) directly utilizes in order to properly create scripts with no logical errors. These parameters can include things like RMS Intervals or Task Timeouts and are directly tied to analyzing the performance of a user on the task. The second class, operating-task parameters, are critical to the proper function of the task, but do not play a role in the performance of the subject. Rather, these parameters are typically designed to manipulate the difficulty of the task on a fundamental level and afford the experimenter precise control over the task, such as how fast the gauges move, the starting value for each of the four tanks, and the user’s callsign. From this point, each class can be further divided by the specific subtask that each parameter applies to (see Figure 056).

From this point on, we will discuss what each parameter does, acceptable values to enter, the default value of each parameter, and a picture of that parameter’s field Some values for the parameters, while logically acceptable, may produce odd behavior in the task and should be avoided. The range/type of values that are acceptable for each parameter will be discussed later.

# Autopilot Maximum Difference Between Tanks

This parameter is used exclusively for the Fuel Autopilot mode. When the Fuel Autopilot is enabled, this parameter sets the threshold for when exactly the Autopilot should use Pumps 7 &#x26; 8. If the difference between Tank A and Tank B is greater than 300 units, the appropriate transfer pump will be used to shift fuel from Tank A to Tank B or vice versa.

# Main Tank Autopilot Ranges

# Lower Limit

This parameter is a setting used exclusively for the Fuel Autopilot mode. If Fuel Autopilot is enabled, the autopilot needs a threshold set for when exactly to use Pumps 1-4. This parameter states that if the volume of Tank A falls below this value, then Pumps 1 &#x26; 2 will turn on. If the volume of Tank B falls below this value, then Pumps 3 &#x26; 4 will turn on. This parameter is designed to help decrease some of the pump activity, as pumps constantly turning on and off may be distracting.

The default value for this parameter is 2350 (units) (see Figure 077).

Appropriate values for this parameter are real numbers greater than 0 but less than the previously defined Tank A &#x26; B Maximum.

# Upper Limit

This parameter is a setting used exclusively for the Fuel Autopilot mode. If Fuel Autopilot is enabled, the autopilot needs a threshold set for when exactly to use Pumps 1-4. This parameter states that if the volume of Tank A is above the set threshold, then Pumps 1 &#x26; 2 will turn off. If the volume of Tank B is above the set threshold, then Pumps 3 &#x26; 4 will turn off. This parameter is designed to help decrease some of the pump activity, as pumps constantly turning on and off may be distracting.

# Hide Tank Changes in Autopilot

This parameter is a setting used exclusively for the Fuel Autopilot mode. The “Hide Tank Changes in Autopilot” option can be used to completely mask pump activities (which may be perceived as distracting). It turns all pumps the same color as the blue “piping” that connects them to the tanks and changes all Pump Status “Flow Rates” to “Auto.” This setting achieves the same effect as the Shift + A command discussed in the Keyboard Commands’ Task Options section and can easily be toggled depending on the participant/experimenter’s preference.

The default value for this parameter is “No” (see Figure 079).

Appropriate values for this parameter are “Yes” &#x26; “No.”

# 8.2.2. System Monitoring Parameters

# Gauge Speed

# Lower Limit

The speeds of gauges are somewhat dependent on the speed of the computer on which the experimenter is running the task. As a result, the experimenter has access to the speed of the gauges in the event that they are moving too fast or too slow. Overall, bringing this number closer to zero will slow the speed of the pointer, while bringing it closer to the Upper Limit will increase the speed of the pointer.

The default value for this parameter is 2 (pixels/second) (see Figure 080).

Appropriate values for this parameter are real numbers greater than 0.

# Higher Limit

The speeds of gauges are somewhat dependent on the speed of the computer on which the experimenter is running the task. As a result, the experimenter has access to the speed of the gauges in the event that they are moving too fast or too slow. This value determines the maximum speed at which the pointers will move. Increasing this value will increase the maximum speed the pointer can reach.

The default value for this parameter is 4 (pixels/second) (see Figure 080).

Appropriate values for this parameter are real numbers greater than the previously mentioned Lower Limit.

PLEASE NOTE: The movement of the pointers is based on a random speed within the defined range. By increasing the difference between the Upper and Lower Limits, the pointer will travel at a wider range of random speeds, whereas a smaller difference will result in a smaller range of speeds.

# End of Range Delay Max (Cycles)

When the pointer on a gauge reaches the top and bottom of its moving range, including both the operating and malfunctioning ranges, the pointer will pause for a set number of cycles. This delay is influenced by the speed of the computer that AF_MATB is running on, so if the delay is not long enough, increase the limit accordingly.

The default value for this parameter is 10 (cycles) (see Figure 081).

Appropriate values for this parameter are integers greater than 0.

# Correct Fault Identification

When a gauge is malfunctioning and a user correctly identifies that malfunction, the pointer on the gauge is returned to the center, where it, as well as a small yellow rectangle, is frozen for a set amount of time. This parameter defines how long the pointer will be frozen in the middle and how long the yellow “correct-identification” indicator will be present before disappearing and allowing the gauge to resume normal function. This delay is influenced by the speed of the computer that AF_MATB is running on, so if the delay is not long enough, increase the limit accordingly.

The default value for this parameter is 10 (cycles) (see Figure 082).

Appropriate values for this parameter are integers greater than 0.

# Slot 3 &#x26; 4 Freq. Increments

This parameter defines the increment at which Comm Channels 3 &#x26; 4 change.

The default value for this parameter is .2 (see Figure 099).

# Enter Confirmation Highlight (Cycles)

This parameter defines the number of cycles the Enter button will stay green for to confirm that a channel and frequency were successfully logged. The button will stay green for the specified amount of cycles before returning to its default blue color. This delay is influenced by the speed of the computer that AF_MATB is running on, so if the delay is not long enough due to a fast machine, increase the limit accordingly.

The default value for this parameter is 12 (cycles) (see Figure 100).

Appropriate values for this parameter are integers greater than 0.

# 8.2.5. Tracking Parameters

# Tracking Gain

This parameter specifies the sensitivity of the joystick for the Tracking Task.

The default value for this parameter is 65 (see Figure 101).

Appropriate values for this parameter are real numbers greater than 40. At parameters below 25, the joystick may not affect the crosshairs when the speed of the crosshair is at maximum. Therefore, Tracking Gain should be greater than 40 to avoid the tracking performance being negatively affected by joystick responsiveness. There is no upper limit for the gain.

| Tracking Gain | 65 | Default Value |
| ------------- | -- | ------------- |

Figure 101 – Tracking Gain.

# Center Range

Used exclusively for the Tracking’s Autopilot mode, this pixel value defines how much the crosshair can bounce normally around the center.

The default value for this parameter is 8 (pixels) (see Figure 102).

Appropriate values for this parameter are real numbers greater than 0.

| Center Range | 8 | Default Value |
| ------------ | - | ------------- |

Figure 102 – Center Range.

# Autopilot Direction Limit

Used exclusively for the Tracking’s Autopilot mode, this parameter is designed to determine the maximum amount of time between direction changes for the tracking crosshair. This value is the maximum number of cycles that the crosshair will maintain a certain direction before changing direction. This value is randomly manipulated, so that direction changes are random.

The default value for this parameter is 5 (cycles) (see Figure 103).

Appropriate values for this parameter are real numbers greater than 0. Recommended to be much smaller than the Manual Direction Limit.

| Autopilot Direction Limit | 5 | Default Value |

# Manual Direction Limit

Used exclusively for the Tracking’s Manual mode, this parameter is designed to determine the maximum amount of time between direction changes for the tracking crosshair. This value is the maximum number of cycles that the crosshair maintains a certain direction before changing direction. This value is randomly manipulated, so that direction changes are random. This number should be much greater than the Autopilot Direction Limit.

The default value for this parameter is 60 (cycles) (see Figure 104).

Appropriate values for this parameter are real numbers greater than 0. However, based on the tracking algorithm, this number should be greater than 10, otherwise the direction changes will be extremely frequent and the crosshair will hover instead of traveling across the screen.

# 9.0 UTILITY BUTTON DESCRIPTIONS

# 9.1. Default Value

Next to each parameter is a Default Value button. If there are ever any questions about what a particular value should be, you can use this button to give you an example of what the typical parameter’s value is. This is particularly useful if a manual is not immediately available. This will also restore the parameter label to black, in the case that the label was red or orange due to the input of incorrect values.

# 9.2. Save Values

This button is used to store a specific set of parameters (see Figure 105). These parameters are stored as a .mat file and can be loaded into AF_MATB_ScriptGenerator, as well as AF_MATB. This button is particularly useful when multiple parameters files need to be saved at one time. A message will be displayed in the GUI that will inform the user that the values were successfully saved.

# Suggestions for rectifying invalid parameter values

Suggestions for rectifying invalid parameter values, like those outlined in Figure 108, can be found in the error log. The error log will itemize every error in a parameters file and suggestions for correcting each parameter listed.

1. Please enter an integer greater than 0 for the maximum delay of the gauges.

# Figure 108

An example of an error log generated as a result of attempting to save a file with an invalid parameter.

To save a parameters file, click Save Values. Once all parameters have been verified as valid, the user would simply select a directory and enter a filename. This filename will automatically have a date and time stamp appended to it to help prevent overwriting. For example, in Figure 109 the user has entered a filename “TestScript1” into the “File name” field. A date and time stamp (i.e. 05-Mar-2010_13-50-26) will automatically be appended to the specified filename, as well as a .mat extension. To change the location of the saved script, simply select a new directory from the “Save in:” dropdown menu.

# 9.3. Set All Default Values

This button will restore all parameters to their predefined default values (see Figure 110). Please keep in mind that this will affect ALL parameters. If there are only a limited number of parameters that need to be reset to their default values, it is best to use the Default Values buttons next to those specific parameters.

# 10.0 AF_MATB_SCRIPTGENERATOR “WHY DO I NEED THIS?”

The goal of this utility is to allow for an experimenter to accurately and efficiently create scripts
without having to manually manipulate event occurrences. AF_MATB_ScriptGenerator takes
into account trial durations, as well as response timeouts for each item in each subtask, to ensure
that there will be no overlap between the same two events. For example, this utility ensures that
Light 1, while instructed to be turned off from 00:00:05 to 00:00:10, will not receive instructions
to be turned off from 00:00:07 to 00:00:12. If this were the case, event durations would be
shortened, which would artificially inflate response timeouts. The Script Generator is designed to
protect against precisely this, ensuring that performance metrics are not compromised by script
instructions. Furthermore, the Script Generator ensures that participants are guaranteed the full
allotment of time to respond to a given event. The utility will also disperse events randomly
throughout a trial, providing better “random” event times than an individual could manually
manipulate on their own. Finally, the utility has built-in protection to maintain the integrity of
this event dispersion. Event maximums are set based on trial time and event timeout so that there
will be no overlap in response times or event occurrences. This also helps ensure that all events
will stay inside a given trial and that their response times will not “bleed” over into the next trial,
if applicable.

# 11.0 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Hardware requirements for the Task Script Generator include 1 GB of RAM, 2 GHz dual-core processor, a keyboard and mouse, and a 15-inch monitor (1280x1024 resolution), at minimum. It is important that these minimum requirements be met to ensure proper function of the utility.

AF_MATB_ScriptGenerator was designed for computers operating on Windows XP SP3 or higher. If the task is executed using a MATLAB script, then version 2007B or later should be used. Otherwise, MATLAB Compiler Runtime 7.8 or later is required.

The Script Generator utilizes Microsoft Excel spreadsheets as a means to output a copy of the script that the experimenter can review. As a result, a copy of Microsoft Excel 2003 or later is required in order for the Script Generator to successfully execute.

Please ensure that your DPI settings are set to default values. If your DPI is set to custom values, you may experience window distortion.

# 12.0 4 KEY COMPONENTS

The Script Generator can be broken down into 4 key parameters. The first set of parameters is the event timeouts, set in the AF_MATB_Parameters utility. The Script Generator directly utilizes those parameters in determining maximum event rates and will code events while taking this into account. Please see AF_MATB_Parameters’ Script-Critical Parameters section for more information about redefining these parameters.

The second parameter critical to the proper functioning of the Script Generator is a valid trial length. Trial lengths can be entered as either seconds or minutes. What defines a valid trial length will be discussed later in this section.

The third set of critical parameters in this utility is valid event rates. This utility simply takes a specific number of event occurrences in a given timeframe, and shuffles each of them around so that they meet all the necessary requirements of a proper script. More detail on the algorithms used in this utility will be discussed later.

The fourth and final parameter for this utility is the trial condition. The Script Generator will not generate a script until a trial condition has been established in the “List of Conditions” list box. The minimum number of trials necessary to create a script is one, and there is no maximum. This allows the experimenter to create scripts that are of considerable length and variety, which allows for more freedom in the experimental design.

# 13.0 “HOW DOES THIS UTILITY WORK?”

The Script Generator uses the 4 critical parameters described in the previous section to first determine if the maximum number of events per trial has been exceeded. If this is the case, or if the user has input any invalid parameters, the user will be notified through the error log, precisely like the one used in AF_MATB_Parameters. This log will have a date and time stamp appended to it, and outline precisely what parameter requirements have not been met, with recommendations on what acceptable values may be used.

Once all input parameters have been validated, the algorithm divides up all subtasks into channels. For example, in the System Monitoring Subtask, there are 6 event channels, four channels for each of the four gauges, and 2 channels for each of the two lights. The event occurrences are then distributed across all channels. In the case of odd-numbered events, such as 13, the event occurrences are distributed in an orderly fashion, so that all channels have 3 events and 1 channel will have an additional event, etc. The only other subtask that has multiple channels is the Resource Management subtask, where each of the eight pumps is a separate channel.

Once the event occurrences have been divided into channels, they are distributed across the specific trial length where it is verified that they fit in the trial and do not exhibit any response overlap. Once all channel timelines have been constructed, the channel timelines are merged back together into a subtask timeline, and eventually, into a master timeline.

This master timeline is arranged in a serial fashion, with the earliest event going first and the latest event going last. The timeline is not segregated by subtask or channel, so events from one subtask will be directly next to events from a different subtask. AF_MATB will read this timeline in a serial fashion and trigger each event as soon as its onset time occurs.

It is important to mention a few key interactions between the script and the task architecture. AF_MATB is designed to cycle every .1 seconds and does so reliably on adequately equipped computers (please see AF_MATB’s hardware requirements for details on adequately equipped computers). Even so, events that are all scheduled to occur inside this window of time can still be executed without problem. For example, in a situation where an event occurs at .12 seconds and another at .17 seconds, both events will be triggered when the task cycles next at .2 seconds. Due to the programming architecture of MATLAB, this was the most efficient and reliable way to trigger events without putting further constraints on event times. Please note that the delayed onset will not compromise response times, as they are adjusted based on the difference between the scheduled onset and true onset.

# 14.0 SCRIPT GENERATOR OUTPUT

After a script has been successfully generated, 2 files will be created. One is a .mat file, which is the file that will be loaded into AF_MATB. The other file is an Excel workbook comprised of 2 worksheets. The first worksheet displays a timeline that is identical to the .mat file that will be read by the task. Each column in the first worksheet conveys certain information.

Column 1 details the time the event is proposed to occur, while Column 5 proposes the timeout for that event. Please keep in mind that these numbers are theoretical and may vary slightly depending on task functioning. Column 2 is used to identify each subtask and channel, while Column 3 defines a particular channel, only. Finally, Column 4 details the exact event that is proposed to occur.

Each event has a unique code, with no code being duplicated. Worksheet 2 is a key that details what actions correspond to which numbers in Column 4. Please note that Worksheet 2 itemizes event codes for all of AF_MATB, not just those event codes the Script Generator uses. As such, there will be a number of event codes that the user will never see encoded in the actual script file.

Both files will be named with whatever filename is specified by the user. In addition, the date and time stamp will also be appended to the files to protect the data from being overwritten.

For an example Excel script, please see Appendix C.

# 15.0 SCRIPT GENERATOR PARAMETERS

# 15.1. Sequence Length

Seconds

This parameter defines the length of time for each trial in seconds. Entering values for this parameter will automatically update the Minute counterpart. This parameter is considered the primary parameter for determining length.

Default values for each trial are 300, 300, 300, and 60 for the Low, Moderate, High, and Transition trials, respectively.

Appropriate values for this parameter are integers greater than zero, though due to the nature of the task, it would not make sense to set trial lengths less than 10 seconds.

Minutes

This parameter defines the length of time for each trial in minutes (see Figure 119). Entering values for this parameter will automatically update the Second counterpart. This parameter is considered the primary parameter for determining length.

Default values for each trial are 5, 5, 5, and 1 for the Low, Moderate, High, and Transition trials, respectively.

Appropriate values for this parameter are real numbers greater than zero, though due to the nature of the task, it would not make sense to set trial lengths less than .17 minutes (10 seconds).

# 15.2. Communications

Target Callsign

This parameter defines the number of communications that will be directed to the participant in a given trial length. These are messages that the participant is instructed to respond to and should correspond with the Caller ID parameter set in AF_MATB_Parameters.

Default values for each trial are 7, 12, 16, and 1 for the Low, Moderate, High, and Transition trials, respectively.

Appropriate values for this parameter are integers greater than or equal to 0. The maximum value is dependent on the amount of time scripted for timeouts, as well as the duration of the trial and the length of each communication. (By default, AF_MATB’s communications are approx. 8 seconds in length.)

Distractor Callsign

This parameter defines the number of communications designated to another plane in a given trial length. These are messages that the participant is instructed to ignore.

Default values for each trial are 1, 4, 6, and 0 for the Low, Moderate, High, and Transition trials, respectively (see Figure 120).

Appropriate values for this parameter are integers greater than or equal to 0. The maximum value is dependent on the timeout, as well as the duration of the trial and of each communication.

PLEASE NOTE: Maximum values for Target and Distractor communications are determined by summing the 2 event counts together. For example, the maximum number of communications for the Communications Task, given default parameters, is 23. Thus, between the Target and Distractor communications, there can only be 23 events, though they can be split in any way. The Script Generator will only notify the user if the sum is greater than the calculated maximum.

| Condition           | Communication Task | Target Callsign | Distractor Callsigns |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | --------------- | -------------------- |
| Low Difficulty      |                    | 7               | 1                    |
| Moderate Difficulty |                    | 12              | 4                    |
| High Difficulty     |                    | 16              | 6                    |

# 15.3. Tracking

# Difficulty

This parameter defines the inputs for the tracking algorithm which manipulate the task’s difficulty. There are three levels of difficulty: Low, Moderate, and High. There is also the option to utilize the Tracking Autopilot. In the Transition trials, an exclusive option was added to manipulate tracking difficulties before or after the transitions. This option is called “Start Next Stage.” It triggers the difficulty of the tracking task during the transition independent of the other tasks in the battery. Thus, the tracking task can switch levels of difficulty before the other tasks, or it can switch to that level of difficulty after the other tasks in the battery have switched. The option to “Start Next Stage” was deemed to be useful for workload studies run in the past.

Default values for each trial are “TRACKING LOW,” “TRACKING MODERATE,” “TRACKING HIGH,” and “Start Next Stage” for the Low, Moderate, High, and Transition trials, respectively.

Appropriate values for this parameter are: “AUTOPILOT,” “TRACKING LOW,” “TRACKING MODERATE,” and “TRACKING HIGH”. For Transition trials, the “Start Next Stage” option was also added.

# Seconds

This parameter, in conjunction with “Start Next Stage,” defines how many seconds before or after a trial ends that the new tracking difficulty should be triggered. This parameter is exclusive only to Transition trials and is only enabled when the tracking difficulty for that trial is selected as “Start Next Stage.”

Default values only exist for the Transition trial, with a default value of 10.

Appropriate values for this parameter are real numbers greater than 0, but less than the length of the Transition trial.

Before/After Next stage

During a Transition trial, the tracking task can be manipulated independent from the other tasks in the battery. At the beginning of a Transition trial, the tracking task can be coded to switch to the new level of difficulty (the difficulty set for the transition) before the other tasks switch. This is the „Before‟ option. Alternately, the tracking task can switch to the new level of difficulty level for the transition trial after the other tasks have switched. This is the „After‟ option. This parameter is exclusive only to Transition trials and is only enabled when the tracking difficulty for this trial is selected as “Start Next Stage.”

Default values only exist for the Transition trial, with a default value of “BEFORE” (see Figure 121).

Appropriate values for this parameter are “BEFORE” or “AFTER”

| Condition           | Tracking Task Difficulty | Seconds Before/After Next Stage |        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ------ |

Default values for each trial are 1, 2, 4, and 1 for the Low, Moderate, High, and Transition trials, respectively (see Figure 124).

Appropriate values for this parameter are integers greater than or equal to 0. The maximum value is recommended to be 50% of the Failures &#x26; Fixes value for the corresponding trial. This is because a pump shut-off will automatically override a pump failure, so to ensure that most, if not all, failures last for their full duration, the number of shut-offs must be less. If this number exceeds 50% of the Failures &#x26; Fixes value, the user will be notified of this by a warning message (Figure 124). However, despite the warning, the script can still be generated even if the parameters set do not meet the recommended values.

|                  | Task      | Resource Management Task |    |                |
| ---------------- | --------- | ------------------------ | -- | -------------- |
| Failures & Fixes | Shut-offs | Fuel Autopilot           |    |                |

Fuel Autopilot
This button in the Resource Management section of the Script Generator allows the user to toggle between setting Failure and Shut-off parameters or enabling the Fuel Autopilot for a given trial.

To enable the Fuel Autopilot, simply click the Fuel Autopilot button. A dropdown menu will appear, with “AUTOPILOT ENABLED” as the current selection (see Figure 125).

To disable the autopilot and return to the screen with the Failure/Shut-off parameters, simply click the dropdown menu, and select “Enter Task Numbers…” This will cause the dropdown menu to disappear and the original input parameter boxes to reappear. At this point, the Fuel Autopilot is now disabled.

# 16.0 CONDITION LIST

The Condition List is designed to indicate the trial structure of a given script. This list allows you to see the arrangement of trials throughout a given run, as well as delete trials from the list. To select a given trial, simply click the Select Low, Moderate, or High Difficulty buttons to the right of the Condition List. The corresponding difficulty will then appear.

To enable transitions between trials, select the “Yes” radio button from the Enable Transitions? box. From this point on, between any two new trials that are added to the Condition List, a “Transition Stage” will be inserted. Please note that enabling transitions is not retroactive; therefore, if the user has trial difficulties already entered in the list, and would like to have transitions enabled, they would need to delete those conditions from the Condition List, enable transitions, and then reselect those trials (see Figure 126).

To delete trials, click on the trial in the Condition List and then click the Delete Condition button to the right of the Condition List. Any trial, including Transition Stages, can be deleted.

# 17.0 VARIABLES CURRENTLY LOADED

This list indicates the values of all AF_MATB_Parameters variables that were transferred into the Script Generator, or the default values that were designated by the Script Generator. This list is particularly useful when the experimenter would like to verify what parameters the Script Generator will use (see Figure 127).

To erase parameters loaded into AF_MATB_ScriptGenerator, click the Delete All Variables button. To restore parameters to their default values, click the Set Variable Defaults button.

Please be aware that if the user clears the Variables Currently Loaded List and then attempts to generate a script, the Script Generator will not function as expected. The user should ensure that either the default values, or custom parameters are loaded into the Script Generator and that those variables appear in this list.

# 18.0  UTILITY BUTTON DESCRIPTIONS

# 18.1. Generate Script

This button is used to generate a single script to be loaded into AF_MATB at a later time.

The save functionality of this program is very similar to that of AF_MATB_Parameters in that it will automatically verify all parameter values and ensure that they are valid values. Any invalid value will have a red parameter label, and the experimenter will be notified that script was not saved (Figure 128).

# 18.5. Generate Script &#x26; Continue to MATB

This button allows the user to save a script and immediately load that script into AF_MATB. This button is useful in situations where the experimenter is interested in testing a specific script.

To save a script, click Generate Script &#x26; Continue to MATB. Once all parameters have been verified, the user should select a directory and enter a filename, just as they would if the Generate Script button was pressed.

All of the rules that applied to the Generate Script button also apply here. If the script is constructed successfully, a message will be displayed in the GUI informing the user of that, followed by a message that AF_MATB is being loaded. Once AF_MATB has been loaded, the Script Generator GUI will dispose and AF_MATB will appear (see Figure 139).

Figure 139 – When selecting Generate Script &#x26; Continue to MATB, the user will first be notified that the script is being constructed. Upon successful completion of script construction, the user will be informed that AF_MATB is loaded. Please see Figure 140 for an example of that notification.

# Loading Parameters and Script Files

This button will load any parameters file, as well as any successfully constructed script file. The parameters loaded from these files will be automatically updated in the appropriate fields, and then automatically loaded into AF_MATB. This button would be ideal for individuals who already have a saved script file and want to load it into AF_MATB immediately.

To load a file, click Load and Continue to Script Generator, select the directory and then the file using the file selection dialog; this process is the same as it would be if the Load Parameters File button was pressed.

All rules that apply to the Load Parameters File button apply here. If the script is loaded successfully, a message will be displayed in the GUI (see Figure 140). This message will inform the user that the script has been loaded and that AF_MATB is in the process of loading. Once AF_MATB has been loaded, the Script Generator GUI will dispose and AF_MATB will appear.

If the script does not load successfully, the script or task parameters file may be corrupt. These files may be unusable at this point, and it is recommended that you restart AF_MATB_ScriptGenerator.
