## ABSTRACT

**Objective:** The objective of this study is to investigate the whether multi-tasking performance in (three-dimensional) 3D aid or impede cognition compare to (two-dimensional) 2D environments, as reflected by cognitive load. Specifically, we aim to examine the mechanism of multi-tasking under 3D (virtual reality [VR]) and 2D (PC monitor) conditions using the widely used Multi-Attribute Task Battery (MATB) II paradigm.

**Methodology:** The MATB-II sub-tasks, namely "Tracking" and "System Monitoring," were conducted with varying task demands in both 3D conditions (Tracking Far - System Monitoring Near [TF-SN], Tracking Near - System Monitoring Far [TN-SF]) and a 2D condition with no depth perception (No Depth [ND]). Participants' cognitive load was assessed using subjective reporting (NASA-TLX) and physiological measure (root mean square of successive difference (RMSSD) of heart rate variability (HRV)).

**Results:** The study found that performance was significantly better in the ND condition compared to the TF-SN and TN-SF conditions. Furthermore, higher NASA-TLX scores and lower RMSSD values were observed in the TF-SN and TN-SN conditions compared to the ND condition, providing additional support for the overall findings of the MATB-II paradigm.

**Conclusion:** These findings suggest that processing multiple tasks in different depth planes may lead to poorer performance and increased subjective and physiological cognitive load.

## 1. Introduction

Multi-tasking is a common phenomenon in human-computer interaction environments, where individuals engage in multiple tasks simultaneously. For example, people may walk on the street while chatting on their smartphones, which can lead to errors or distractions. Similarly, individuals may drive a car while simultaneously adjusting the steering wheel and controlling the air conditioning, which can also result in decreased efficiency in car driving. Therefore, it is important to investigate how individuals process and manage multi-tasking to enhance human-computer interaction efficiency.

The Multi-Attribute Task Battery (MATB) II, developed by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) [11], is a widely used tool to measure multi-task performance. It has been validated for assessing the cooperation and competition among multiple tasks and provides a controlled experimental environment that mirrors the cognitive challenges of aircraft piloting. The MATB-II consists of four sub-tasks, System monitoring, Tracking, Auditory communication, and Resource management—each presented on a computer monitor, along with a scheduling view that integrates incoming task events. A key feature of the MATB-II is its applicability to individuals with no prior aviation experience, making it an accessible tool for a wide range of researchers. These sub-tasks are presented on a computer monitor with varied spatial locations, and participants' performance on each sub-task

is calculated to evaluate overall MATB-II performance.

However, in real-life multi-tasking scenarios, individuals often process sub-tasks with different spatial fields of depth. For instance, they may view a smartphone in a near spatial location while simultaneously observing the surrounding environment in the distance. Similarly, while driving, individuals need to steer the vehicle based on information from the far surroundings while simultaneously controlling navigation systems located near them. Additionally, in the context of aircraft control, pilots need to integrate feedback from both the external environment and internal flight instruments to adjust their flight attitude. Such situations require the integration of cognitive resources that switch between near and far spatial fields of depth. In all sub-tasks of MATB-II, "Tracking" and "System Monitoring" are two of the most common tasks in accord with real piloting situations. "Tracking", which involves continuous compensatory actions, and "System Monitoring", which requires monitoring and responding to flight instrument signals. Considering that the current version of the MATB-II does not measure multi-tasks in different depth locations, we utilized the Open MATB-II [7] to address this issue by configuring its sub-tasks at different spatial fields of depth.

The performance of multi-tasking is influenced by the presentation of tasks in a three-dimensional (3D) environment with varying fields of depth. Firstly, multi-tasking is influenced by the allocation of attention attracted by 3D stimuli. Participants can easily and concurrently allocate attentional resources to track moving targets at different fields of depths compared to tracking objects at a single depth [54]. The ability to track objects in varied depth planes facilitates the use of an attentional strategy and contributes to improved multi-tasking performance [12, 16]. However, other studies suggest that there is a greater attentional cost associated with switching attention between two depth planes, leading to higher cognitive load [15,2,34]. These studies propose that attention to varied depth planes remains controversial in multi-tasking performance.

Additionally, the way in which people process 3D stimuli affects multi-tasking. Some researchers argue that 3D stimuli can enhance cognitive processing [10,23,53]. However, other researchers suggest that the use of 3D stimuli can have negative effects, requiring additional information processing and more cognitive resources [31,36]. These differing perspectives can be explained by the meaning provided by the additional information presented through 3D stimuli during the task. The extent to which the stimuli resemble real-world scenarios can reduce cognitive load by activating memorized patterns stored in long-term memory [33]. Similarly, stimuli with motion-in-depth can provide positive information, further reducing cognitive load [55].

It is important to note that previous studies did not clarify the inclusion and exclusion criteria regarding the informative meaning of 3D stimuli. In experiments involving a 3D environment with depth information, the utilization of depth information in spatial attention processing is selective and dependent on specific conditions: whether tasks are depth-relevant and participants are encouraged to utilize depth cues [17], whether depth information is presented for a short duration [40], and whether participants have prior knowledge of depth planes [19]. Therefore, investigating multi-tasking in the context of depth is necessary to provide evidence on how multi-tasking is performed in a real 3D environment.

3D depth information can provide a performance boost in certain cognitive tasks, its effectiveness is nuanced and dependent on the specific demands of the task and the individual's cognitive capacity. Working memory capacity and increased working memory load have been estimated as predictors of MATB-II performance [20,27]. Reeves and Lei [41] challenged the notion of depth's influence on visual short-term memory (VSTM), concluding that VSTM is effectively two-dimensional. Their research indicated that depth information had minimal impact on memory capacity or the decay of information in VSTM. However, recent other researchers have revealed that depth information can enhance executive functions, particularly visual working memory and selective attention, under challenging conditions [46,45]. Sarno and Neider [46] show inhibitory control is unaffected by depth, Sarno et al. [45] uncover that depth benefits vary with individual capacity and memory load, suggesting depth serves as a conditional cognitive aid. Both studies highlight the importance of task demands and individual differences in leveraging depth to improve performance.

Cognitive load measurement can provide additional information about how individuals perform multi-tasking tasks within the same plane or across varied planes. MATB-II performance by itself is an objective marker of cognitive load [39,44]. Additionally, we utilized a widely used subjective measure of cognitive load as supporting evidence, the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX). It is a multidimensional rating scale developed by Hart and Staveland [22], encompassing six factors that sufficiently represent the sources of cognitive workload across different tasks. The validity of the NASA-TLX extends beyond the aerospace domain and is applicable in various fields such as transportation, military, and surgery [21].

Heart rate variability (HRV), known for its non-invasive nature, is widely used as an indicator of perceived demand due to its association with prefrontal cortex activity based on the neurovisceral integration model [51,50]. It has been confirmed to be a reliable indicator, particularly in assessing perceptual demand during tasks related to working memory [28,29]. Luque-Casado et al. [28] found a potential dissociation between subjective measures (NASA-TLX) and objective measures of HRV of mental workload. They suggest that HRV can serve as physiological indicators that may be more sensitive to overall changes in cognitive loads from task demands.

Therefore, it is essential to collect both NASA-TLX and HRV data simultaneously during MATB-II tasks, conducted on both two-dimensional (2D) personal computer (PC) monitors and in virtual reality (VR) environments, to comprehensively evaluate cognitive load subjectively, objectively, and physiologically.

## The present study

There are numerous studies available on the topic of multi-task processing using 2D monitors. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the performance and mechanism of the Multi-Attribute Task Battery II (MATB-II) in both a 3D (VR) and 2D (PC monitor) environment.

In a 3D environment, multi-task processing may initially require visual attention to be drawn towards 3D stimuli, followed by the utilization of additional information provided by each sub-task for perception. Following visual attention in 3D, we manipulated the placement of each sub-task of 3D-MATB-II at different fields of depth within the virtual reality setting. In the 3D-MATB-II, while each sub-task aimed to simulate real-world depth perception through the provision of depth information, the stimuli presented limitations in their spatial representation. Specifically, stimuli were confined to a single depth plane, utilizing 2D elements, and the stimuli did not include motion-in-depth, which is a critical aspect of naturalistic spatial interactions. Consequently, the dynamic spatial interactions typically experienced in real-world environments were not fully replicated. For the depth information, Reeves and Lei [41] suggested that VSTM operates effectively in 2D, with depth information having a negligible impact on memory capacity or decay rates. Other studies also highlight the conditional benefits of incorporating depth information into tasks that tax cognitive resources, with the potential to enhance performance in VWM and selective attention [46,45]. To compare the different task demands of 3D-MATB-II, we developed a 2D version of MATB-II for comparison purposes.

Do 3D stimuli aid or impede cognition? It hinges on task relevance. Helpful when 3D offers unique insights, but potentially burdensome when unrelated, adding perceptual load without extra information. As reviewed above, we remain unclear how the unique task characteristics of MATB-II under 2D and 3D environments. Therefore, the null

hypothesis (H0) for this study is that there is no significant difference in MATB-II task performance between 3D and 2D environments. The alternative hypothesis (H1) posits that there is a significant difference in MATB-II task performance between the two environments, with the expectation that 3D stimuli will either aid or impede cognitive performance depending on task relevance.

Additionally, monitoring and controlling multi-tasks with varying spatial fields of depth is highly relevant to ergonomic considerations, particularly in the domain of aviation. Existing studies have not investigated how individuals monitor and control multi-tasks with different depth levels. Consequently, it is inappropriate to directly apply their findings to multi-task environments where sub-tasks are distributed across varying spatial fields of depth. This study aims to clarify the role of depth information in MATB-II performance and provide an understanding of how individuals process multi-tasks with diverse spatial fields of depth.

## Method

### Participants

Power analysis (G-Power) was calculated using the medium effect size of 0.25. It indicated that a sample of 43 participants would yield 0.95 power at α =.05. We utilize an appointment system to recruit participants, and guide participants to ensure sufficient sleep on the previous night of experiments. We also examined the mental state of each participant by asking whether they were uncomfortable including drowsy. We recruited 53 participants to avoid potential participant loss owing to simulation sickness in VR environments. Four participants reported their uncomfortableness during VR experiments and they were excluded. Altogether, there are 49 participants (M = 18.63 years, SD = 0.78, female = 24) included in the analysis. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, were right-handed had not previously participated in similar experiments, and were not color blind or color deficient. After completing the experiment, all participants received monetary rewards. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shaanxi Normal University.

### Stimuli

In this study, we utilized a simplified open version of the MATB-II software, developed by the NASA of the United States, called Open MATB [7]. To meet the measurement under a VR environment, we simplified the original four-task MATB program to two tasks: Tracking and System monitoring.

#### Tracking and System monitoring task

The Tracking task entailed the utilization of a flight control stick by participants to ensure that a cursor remained within a rectangular target area, simulating the operation of an aircraft during flight. The movement of the cursor followed a predetermined function that consisted of combined sine waves along the X and Y axes, resulting in a random deviation of the cursor's trajectory akin to that of a Lissajous curve. Notwithstanding the application of cursor compensation, all participants encountered an identical cursor path. Feedback was provided in the form of a green color when the cursor resided within the target area, while a red color was displayed when it deviated from the area. The entirety of the task necessitated manual control, with participants employing the flight control stick to keep the cursor within the target area and as close to the center as possible. Real-time coordinates of the cursor were automatically captured by the software at an approximate frequency of 50 times per second.

The Tracking task placed substantial demands on participants, requiring a greater investment of cognitive resources. To explore the impact of varying task demands on 3D-MATB-II performance, we manipulated the cutoff frequency of the cursor movement function in the Tracking task. Higher frequencies corresponded to more pronounced fluctuations. Specifically, under conditions of low task load, the cutoff frequency was set at 0.1, while under conditions of high task load, it was set at 0.2. We managed only the Tracking sub-task's task demand because participants were instructed to complete two sub-tasks at once throughout the experiment. Both sub-tasks were crucial. If the Tracking sub-task consumed more cognitive resources under higher task demand, this could reduce the cognitive resources available for the System Monitoring sub-task, which is also affected by task demand.

In the System monitoring task, participants were tasked with monitoring the aircraft's status for anomalies and taking corrective action when necessary. Abnormal engine temperature and pressure were indicated by two warning lights. In normal conditions, the left warning light labeled "OPERATE" appeared in gray, indicating normal engine temperature, while the right warning light labeled "FAIL" displayed a background color, denoting normal engine pressure. When engine temperature or pressure deviated from normal, the left warning light transitioned from dark gray to the background color, and the right warning light transitioned from the background color to dark gray. Participants were instructed to rectify the corresponding anomaly within 2 seconds using the left or right arrow key on the keyboard. Correct responses promptly restored the warning light to its default state, while incorrect responses were recorded as errors. For each MATB-II condition, one error was randomly presented every six seconds, and a total of 60 errors during 6 min for the system monitoring task. 30 errors in each random response for the abnormal condition of "OPERATE" or "FAIL".

The software automatically logged the timing of faults and participant responses. The modified tasks served as experimental instruments to evaluate participants' capacity to process multiple tasks within an aviation context. All experimental programs were programmed in Python and recorded participants' response data.

The two tasks were undertaken concurrently, necessitating participants to exert a high level of control over both task timing and task processing sequence, consistent with a concurrent multitasking framework. Each MATB-II condition The Logitech Extreme 3D Pro flight control joystick served as the response device for the target tracking task, while the keyboard was utilized to respond to the system monitoring task. Participants were required to utilize both hands simultaneously to perform the tasks with maximum accuracy and speed, without any differentiation in priority between the two tasks.

#### MATB-II in 2D and 3D environment

In the 2D environment, the Tracking and System monitoring tasks were positioned at the central top and central bottom regions of a 27-inch personal computer (PC) monitor. The monitor had a resolution of 1920 ×1080 pixels and a refresh rate of 60 Hz. It was placed approximately 80 cm away from the participant's eyes. The visual angles of each sub-task were approximately 14° horizontally and 12° vertically. The presentation of the tasks on the PC monitor served as the control condition without depth perception.

In the 3D (VR) environment, the Tracking and System monitoring tasks were presented between two planes with varying fields of depth, unlike the 2D environment described above (see Fig. 1). To ensure a balanced presentation of the tasks in the 3D VR environment, two depth conditions were adopted: Tracking Far-system monitoring Near (TF-SN) and Tracking Near - System monitoring Far (TN-SF). The VR environment was created using the HTC Vive Pro kit, which included the HTC Vive Pro Eye head-mounted display (HMD) and two SteamVR Base Station 2.0 units. The HMD had a dual-eye resolution of 2880 ×1600 pixels (1440 ×1600 pixels per eye), a refresh rate of 90 Hz, and a field of view of 110°.

Within the 3D VR environment, following the paradigm established by Maringelli et al. [34] and Losier and Klein (2004), the stimuli were presented on different depth planes within the VR display. Specifically, the target tracking task and system monitoring task were displayed on

two separate large screens located at different fields of depth, with a 70 cm difference in depth between the screens. The "Tracking" task and "System Monitoring" tasks were presented to participants with borderless screens and the background was all black with no information. The upper screen always presented the target tracking task, while the lower screen always presented the system monitoring task. The stimuli used in the 2D-MATB-II condition corresponded to the section between the two screens. Consequently, the distance from participants to the nearer screen (with a visual angle of 25° horizontally and 21° vertically) was 45 cm, whereas the distance to the farther screen (with a visual angle of 8° horizontally and 7° vertically) was 115 cm. Therefore, the invisibility mid-plane between two far-near planes was 70 cm, identical to a PC monitor.

SOMNOtouch™ RESP instrument was securely fastened to the subject's chest using a Velcro strap, allowing for the recording of ECG data. Subsequently, these data were transmitted to a computer via the physiological recorder base and DOMINO light software.

To assess cognitive load resulting from task demands, we employed the root mean square successive difference (RMSSD), a parameter derived from HRV that reflects parasympathetic nervous system activity. RMSSD is associated with prefrontal cortex activity within the framework of neurovisceral integration [35]. It has been suggested as an objective measure of cognitive load [57] and is less prone to the impact of changes in respiration rate compared to frequency domain measures [42].

## 2.3. Procedure

In this study, the participants were required to complete six conditions of the MATB-II. These conditions included a combination of two levels of Task Demand (High and Low) and three levels of spatial depth fields (No spatial depth, TF-SN, and TN-SF). To account for potential practice and fatigue effects, the sequence of these six tasks was determined using a Latin square design, ensuring an equal distribution of task orders among all participants.

The entire experimental procedure took place in a quiet indoor environment. Before the commencement of the experiment, participants provided written consent. They were then asked to wear a physiological recorder to record five minutes of resting-state physiological data, during which their emotional state was expected to stabilize. Subsequently, the experimenter provided detailed instructions to the participants, and two practice sessions of two minutes were conducted. During this practice session, participants were allowed to clarify any doubts regarding the task instructions and familiarize themselves with the relevant operations. If participants did not fully comprehend the task instructions or were not sufficiently familiar with the operations, they were given additional practice sessions until they demonstrated complete understanding and familiarity.

Each MATB-II condition, which involved varying task demands in both the 2D and 3D environments, lasted for six minutes. The total experimental time for each participant was approximately 45 min.

### 2.3.1. HRV

Throughout each task, the SOMNOtouch™ RESP physiological recorder was utilized to capture the subject's electrocardiogram (ECG) signals at a sampling rate of 256 Hz. The ECG signals were obtained using three disposable Ag-AgCl electrode patches, which were affixed to the subject's left and right clavicles as well as the left lower rib. The

### 2.3.2. NASA-TLX

The NASA-TLX is a scale used to assess cognitive load across six dimensions, comprising the following items: Mental Demand, Physical Demand, Temporal Demand, Performance, Effort, and Frustration [22]. Each item is rated on an 11-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (never) to 10 (very high). After each MATB-II task, participants were required to complete the NASA-TLX scale to evaluate their perceived cognitive load during the tasks.

## 2.4. Data calculating

Firstly, the calculation of accuracy and deviation of the Tracking task in the MATB-II and the accuracy and reaction times (RTs) in the system monitoring task were conducted. The accuracy in the Tracking task represents the proportion of time that the cursor, manipulated by participants, remains within the designated target area [3], while deviation indicates the relative difference between the center point of the cursor and the center point of the target area. Moreover, accuracy in the system monitoring task pertains to the percentage of correct responses to detected system faults, and reaction time refers to the temporal interval between each occurrence of a system anomaly and the participants' corresponding keypress.

For the processing of HRV parameters, two experienced experimenters initially employed the DOMINO light 14.0 software (SOMNOmedics, Germany) to filter and eliminate aberrant heartbeats from the imported raw electrocardiogram (ECG) data, generating participants' RR intervals. Subsequently, all RR intervals were input into Kubios HRV 3.5.0 software for analysis, allowing for derivation of the RMSSD parameters.

Next, scores for the NASA-TLX was computed. In this study, the raw score of the NASA-TLX scale was utilized, as it has demonstrated acceptability in measuring cognitive load during the MATB-II tasks [18, 43,56]. Accordingly, we computed and compared the scores for each

dimension and the total score to examine subjective cognitive load across different Task Demands and Spatial depth field conditions. Additionally, all participants in our sample reported no sickness symptoms that could potentially interfere with or influence their performance in the VR environment.

In summary, a series of within-subjects repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were conducted to analyze the differences in terms of accuracy and deviation of the Tracking task, accuracy and RTs of the system monitoring task, RMSSD parameters, as well as all dimensions and the total score of the NASA-TLX scale, based on the factors of Task Demand (High, Low) and Depth (ND, TF-SN, TN-SF). The data analyses were performed using IBM SPSS software version 26.0.

## 3. Results

Before reporting the results, the sample recruitment and trial design may have limitations. The most of participants in this study are recruited from university students in early adulthood. It may narrow the findings among different age groups. In this study, the total time for each participant is a bit long. Shorter trials and fewer trials per participant may yield higher-quality results.

The present study involves an analysis of participants' performance in the MATB-II, specifically in the Tracking and System Monitoring tasks. Additionally, we examine participants' scores on the NASA-TLX and HRV values. This analysis aims to compare the differences in NASA-TLX scores and HRV values across different presentation modes and task requirements. Through this analysis, we intend to investigate whether participants' perceived task load demonstrates significant variations based on both subjective and objective indicators. Furthermore, we compare the performance of spatial depth fields and task load between the tracking tasks and system monitoring tasks to test our hypotheses.

### 3.1. MATB-II

#### 3.1.1. Tracking

The results revealed a significant main effect of Task Demand (F(1, 48) = 352.48, p <.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.880), indicating a decrease in accuracy when participants performed the tracking task under higher task demand. Additionally, there was a significant main effect of Spatial depth fields (F(2, 96) = 115.01, p <.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.706). Post-hoc analyses revealed that in the tracking task, the accuracy of the ND condition (M<sub>ND</sub> = 0.544, SE = 0.024) was significantly higher than the accuracy of the TF-SN condition (M<sub>TF-SN</sub> = 0.312, SE = 0.015, p <.001) and the TN-SF condition (M<sub>TN-SF</sub> = 0.346, SE = 0.018, p <.001). Furthermore, the accuracy of the TF-SN condition was significantly lower than the accuracy of the TN-SF condition (p =.003).

Furthermore, a significant interaction effect was observed between Spatial depth fields and Task Demand (F(2, 96) = 23.67, p <.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.330) (see Fig. 2a). Under low task demands, ND yielded significantly higher accuracy compared to TF-SN (M<sub>ND</sub> = 0.712, SE = 0.028, M<sub>TF-SN</sub> = 0.416, SE = 0.023, p <.001) and TN-SF (M<sub>ND</sub> = 0.712, SE = 0.028, M<sub>TN-SF</sub> = 0.464, SE = 0.026, p <.001). TN-SF exhibited significantly higher accuracy than TF-SN (p =.004). Under high task demands, ND also showed significantly higher accuracy than TF-SN (M<sub>ND</sub> = 0.376, SE = 0.024, M<sub>TF-SN</sub> = 0.207, SE = 0.008, p <.001) and TN-SF (M<sub>ND</sub> = 0.376, SE = 0.024, M<sub>TN-SF</sub> = 0.227, SE = 0.012, p <.001). TN-SF displayed significantly higher accuracy than TF-SN (p =.021).

Additionally, we also calculated the accuracy (ACC) difference of the Tracking task (M<sub>low demand</sub> - M<sub>high demand</sub>) between two Task Demand conditions in three Spatial depth fields. We submitted 3 Spatial depth fields (ND, TF-SN, TN-SF) within-subjects repeated-measures ANOVA on ACC difference of tracking. There was a significant main effect of Spatial depth fields (F(2, 96) = 23.665, p <.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.330). Post-hoc analysis indicated ACC difference of Tracking in ND, TF-SN and TN-SF was significantly different between each other (M<sub>ND</sub> = 33.616 ± 1.861, M<sub>TF-SN</sub> = 20.955 ± 1.753, M<sub>TN-SF</sub> = 23.721 ± 1.734, both ps < 0.05) (see Fig. 2b).

For the deviation of the Tracking task, a significant main effect of Task Demand (F(1, 48) = 368.601, p <.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.885), indicating an increase in deviation when participants performed the tracking task under higher task demand. Additionally, there was a significant main effect of Spatial depth fields (F(2, 96) = 63.570, p <.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.570). Post-hoc analyses revealed that in the tracking task, the deviation of the ND condition (M<sub>ND</sub> = 0.084, SE = 0.004) was significantly higher than the accuracy of the TF-SN condition (M<sub>TF-SN</sub> = 0.121, SE = 0.004, p <.001) and the TN-SF condition (M<sub>TN-SF</sub> = 0.117, SE = 0.004, p <.001) (see Fig. 2c). Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the deviation of the TF-SN e TN-SF condition (p =.186). The interaction between Spatial depth fields and Task Demand was not significant (F(2, 96) = 1.154, p =.320, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.023).

#### 3.1.2. System monitoring

Among the results focusing on accuracy (see Fig. 3a), there was a significant main effect of task demands (F(1, 48) = 4.32, p =.043, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.083), indicating a decrease in accuracy when participants performed the system monitoring task under high task load (M<sub>High</sub> = 0.943, SE = 0.009, M<sub>Low</sub> = 0.951, SE = 0.009, p =.043). Additionally, there was a significant main effect of spatial depth fields (F(2, 96) = 10.32, p <.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.177). Post-hoc analyses revealed that the accuracy in the ND condition (M<sub>ND</sub> = 0.960, SE = 0.009) was significantly higher than the accuracy in the TN-SF condition (M<sub>TN-SF</sub> = 0.932, SE = 0.011, p <.001),

Abbreviations: ND = No depth, TF-SN = Tracking Far - System monitoring Near, TN-SF = Tracking Near - System monitoring Far.

and the accuracy in the TF-SN condition (M<sub>TF-SN</sub> = 0.950, SE = 0.009) was significantly higher than the accuracy in the TN-SF condition (p = .010). However, there was no significant difference in accuracy between the ND and TF-SN conditions (p = .102). Furthermore, there was no significant interaction effect between spatial depth fields and task demands (F(2, 96) = 0.589, p = .557, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.012).

Furthermore, in the analysis of RTs (see Fig. 3b), only spatial depth fields showed a significant main effect (F(2, 96) = 75.31, p < .001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.611), while task demands did not exhibit a significant main effect (F(1, 48) = 0.330, p = .568, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.007), and there was no significant interaction effect between task demands and spatial depth fields (F(2, 96) = 2.982, p = .055, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.058). Post-hoc analyses revealed that in terms of spatial depth fields, the RTs in the ND condition (M<sub>ND</sub> = 796.543, SE = 17.765), TF-SN condition (M<sub>TF-SN</sub> = 906.635, SE = 17.907, p < .001) and TN-SF condition (M<sub>TN-SF</sub> = 936.252, SE = 17.375, p < .001) was significantly different between each other (all ps < .01).

### 3.1.3. NASA-TLX and HRV

Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics for each dimensional score of NASA-TLX and HRV, while the results of the ANOVA are displayed in Table 2. The focus of our investigation centers on the simple effects derived from the significant main effects of Spatial depth fields and the interactions between Task Demand and Spatial depth fields.

Significant main effects of Spatial depth fields were observed on the NASA-TLX dimensional scores and RMSSD. Specifically, significant main effects were found for TS, mental, physical, temporal, effort, and frustration dimensions of NASA-TLX. Subsequently, post-hoc analyses were conducted on these variables. Results from the post-hoc analysis indicated that ND consistently yielded significantly lower scores compared to TF-SN and TN-SF across TS, mental, physical, temporal, effort, and frustration dimensions. Moreover, no significant differences in scoring were consistently observed between TF-SN and TN-SF. Post-hoc analysis was also performed on RMSSD, with results aligning with the outcomes from NASA-TLX.

Furthermore, no significant interaction effects were found between task demands and spatial depth fields concerning the overall score and dimensions of NASA-TLX and HRV (please refer to Table 2 for detailed results).

To summarize, different levels of task load correspond to both lower and higher task demands, as evidenced by both subjective and objective measures. Subjectively, lower task demands indicate lower psychological and physical load, along with reduced effort and frustration. Objectively, higher task demands are associated with reduced parasympathetic nervous system excitability and increased sympathetic nervous system excitability, leading to elevated levels of stress. Additionally, although the presence or absence of spatial depth fields leads to varying levels of perceived task load in subjective assessments and objective measures, the spatial proximity of tracking tasks and system monitoring tasks (whether in near or far space) does not result in significant differences in the perceived task load reported by participants in both subjective assessments and objective measures when under the same spatial depth field. This suggests that, regardless of the spatial location of the tasks, the task load reflected in subjective assessments and objective measures remains consistent under the same spatial depth field.

## 4. Discussion

In the present study, we investigated how people process multi-tasking such as MATB-II under different spatial depth fields. We found participants performed better in the Tracking task and System monitoring task under ND conditions rather than TF-SN and TN-SF conditions. The H0 is rejected and the H1 is supported. We suggested this result may be attributed to more cognitive load demand for 3D MATB-II than 2D. In addition, we collected the NASA-TLX questionnaire score as a subjective parameter and the HRV value as an objective parameter in each spatial depth field. The higher NASA-TLX score and lower RMSSD value in TF-SN and TN-SN than in ND also supported the overall MATB-II performance.

Our findings indicate that participants demonstrated superior performance in the Tracking task and System monitoring task under the ND condition compared to the TF-SN and TN-SF conditions. This outcome suggests that the higher cognitive load associated with the 3D-MATB-II, as opposed to the 2D version, maybe a contributing factor. Additionally, we collected subjective ratings using the NASA-TLX questionnaire and objective HRV values for each spatial depth field. The higher NASA-TLX scores and lower RMSSD values in the TF-SN and TN-SF conditions, compared to the ND condition, further support the overall lower performance of the 3D-MATB-II than 2D MATB-II.

The results across all three spatial depth fields suggest a lower cognitive load in the ND condition of the 2D-MATB-II compared to both the TN-SF and TF-SN conditions of the 3D-MATB-II. In our study, we manipulated the stimuli in the 3D-MATB-II from a single spatial depth in the 2D version to varying fields of depth in the 3D version. The stimuli for each sub-task were not transformed from 2D patterns into a real-time visual representation of a realistic avatar. Furthermore, the stimuli for each sub-task were only presented at the same spatial depth, without additional binocular cues or motion-in-depth stimuli [13,55]. Consequently, we suggest that 3D multi-tasks presented solely with spatial depth information may not provide enough informative cues.

If this assumption holds, it can reasonably explain the consistent indicators, including behavioral performance, subjective ratings, and objective physiological measures, when comparing 2D and 3D multi-tasking.

The 3D-MATB-II used in this study, which includes two sub-tasks presented at different depth planes, may require a strategy of rapid attentional switching to meet the overall task demands [9,24]. It is worth noting that attentional switching across different depth planes may incur additional attentional costs, resulting in higher reaction times [2,34]. This increased attentional cost may, in turn, lead to a greater demand for cognitive resources [1,26,5]. Hence, the inferior performance observed in the 3D-MATB-II could be attributed to the heightened attentional cost and subsequent cognitive load.

Additionally, our study's findings that 2D-MATB-II performance surpasses that of 3D tasks seem to contrast with the general implications of VWM and selective attention drawn from the literature. Sarno and Neider [46] suggest depth of information can enhance executive functions like VWM and selective attention, particularly under challenging conditions. However, our results align with Reeves and Lei's [40] conclusion that VSTM is effectively two-dimensional, with depth playing a minimal role. This discrepancy might be attributed to the specific task demands of our study, where perhaps the additional cognitive load required to process 3D information did not provide a strategic advantage, as suggested by Sarno et al. [45] for individuals. It underscores the need for further investigation into the conditions under which 3D displays offer cognitive benefits over traditional 2D interfaces.

Objective, subjective, and physiological indicators consistently point towards the increased cognitive load in the 3D-MATB-II, evident in lower performance, lower RMSSD values, and higher scores on the NASA-TLX. These findings suggest that the spatial depth information provided is not sufficiently informative for processing, and instead requires an additional cognitive load. Consequently, the present results suggest a negative impact associated with the inclusion of spatial depth fields in a VR environment. This observation aligns with the suggestion by Dan and Reiner [14] that the cognitive processing difference between 2D and 3D stimuli depends on the informative nature of the 3D information. Their research indicates that under highly informative conditions, where there is a reliable, exact, real-time visual representation of a realistic avatar, the processing of 3D stimuli is efficient. However, under low informative conditions, the processing of 3D stimuli with added spatial depth cues compared to 2D stimuli leads to an increased level of cognitive resource allocation.

In sum, our study investigated how individuals process multi-tasking in a 3D environment compared to a 2D environment. The inclusion of spatial depth information between sub-tasks is considered less informative and therefore induces a higher cognitive load through increased attentional cost.

### 4.1. Limitations and future research

The current study has emphasized the increased cognitive load involved in processing multi-tasking tasks, particularly in the context of the MATB-II when presented with varying fields of depth. However, further investigation is required to comprehensively understand the mechanisms underlying the heightened cognitive load. In particular, the use of eye-tracking techniques within a VR environment needs to be explored to validate its utility and feasibility. According to a mobilization model of sustained attention performance, capacity is primarily demand-driven, which means that it is the immediate demands of the task that trigger capacity supply [48]. Some VR environments may raise increased perceptual load that enhances capacity supply and may affect task performance. Future studies can define the control of perceptual load in VR.

## 5. Conclusions

This study contributes to the current body of knowledge by enhancing our comprehension of users' perception and cognitive processing of multi-tasks involving varying depth planes. The findings reveal that the performance in processing multi-tasks with different spatial depth planes is inferior compared to that of tasks with consistent depth planes. This observed decline in performance may be attributed to the heightened cognitive load experienced both subjectively and physiologically.
