# Multi-Attribute Task Battery (MATB) for Military Aircrew Assessment: A Comprehensive Research Report

## Executive Summary

The Multi-Attribute Task Battery (MATB) represents one of the most widely utilized and validated cognitive assessment platforms in aviation research, specifically designed to evaluate operator performance and workload in complex multitasking environments. Originally developed by NASA in the early 1990s, MATB has evolved through multiple iterations and has found extensive application in military aircrew selection, certification, and operational assessment.[linkinghub.elsevier+2](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2590093524000560)

## MATB Development and Evolution

## Historical Foundation

The original Multi-Attribute Task Battery was developed at NASA's Langley Research Center in the early 1990s by Comstock and Arnegard. The system was designed to provide a benchmark set of tasks analogous to activities that aircraft crew members perform in flight, with the flexibility to accommodate non-pilot subjects. The simultaneous performance of multiple tasks is the central feature of MATB, making it consistent with most operational systems and thus valuable as a research platform.[matb.larc.nasa+1](https://matb.larc.nasa.gov/)

## Modern Iterations

**MATB-II**: The NASA Langley Research Center developed an updated version (MATB-II) that was re-implemented under Microsoft Visual Studio.NET, providing enhanced functionality while maintaining the core task structure. This version is available through the official NASA website and has become the standard for many research applications.[ntrs.nasa+1](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20110014456/downloads/20110014456.pdf)

**USAARL MATB**: The U.S. Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory (USAARL) developed their own enhanced version that builds upon the traditional MATB foundation while introducing innovations such as subtask variations, dynamic demand transitions, and performance-driven adaptive automation handoffs. This version represents a significant advancement in research platforms for human performance assessment and automation studies.[frontiersin+1](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnrgo.2024.1435588/full)

**OpenMATB**: Developed as an open-source variant to address limitations in task customization, software extensibility, and experiment replicability. This Python-based implementation promotes task customization through plugin systems and simplified script formats.[link.springer+1](http://link.springer.com/10.3758/s13428-020-01364-w)

**AF-MATB**: The U.S. Air Force developed a colorized version using colors similar to cockpit instruments for enhanced ecological validity in laboratory research.[dtic+1](http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA611870)

## Core Task Components

MATB consists of four primary aviation-like tasks that operators must perform simultaneously:[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih+2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11300324/)

## 1. System Monitoring (SYSMON)

Simulates instrument monitoring requirements where operators must detect the absence of green warning lights, presence of red lights, and monitor four moving pointers for deviations from center position. This task evaluates vigilance and attention allocation capabilities.[sciencedirect+1](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590093524000560)

## 2. Tracking (TRACK)

Requires manual control using a joystick to maintain a target at the center of a graduated scale. This task can be automated to simulate reduced manual requirements with autopilot, making it valuable for studying automation effects.[linkinghub.elsevier+1](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2590093524000560)

## 3. Communications (COMM)

Operators respond to pre-recorded auditory messages at selected intervals, determining which messages are relevant and responding by selecting appropriate radio frequencies. This task assesses auditory processing, working memory, and selective attention.[sciencedirect+1](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590093524000560)

## 4. Resource Management (RESMAN)

Simulates fuel management by requiring operators to maintain fuel levels at 2500 units in containers A and B through pump operations. Pump failures may occur, indicated by red warning signs. This task evaluates problem-solving, decision-making, and resource allocation skills.[linkinghub.elsevier+1](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2590093524000560)

## Military Applications and Implementations

## Personnel Selection

MATB has demonstrated significant utility in military aircrew selection processes. Research indicates that cognitive assessment batteries including MATB-type tasks show predictive validity for pilot training outcomes. The system's ability to assess multiple cognitive domains simultaneously makes it particularly valuable for identifying candidates with the multitasking abilities essential for military aviation.[cfc.forces+2](https://www.cfc.forces.gc.ca/259/290/49/286/Anon903.pdf)

Military organizations have incorporated MATB principles into their selection batteries:

- **U.S. Navy**: The Aviation Selection Test Battery (ASTB) incorporates multitasking cognitive assessment components similar to MATB for selecting approximately 1,100 pilots annually from 6,000 applicants.[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12364792/)
    
- **Canadian Armed Forces**: The Canadian Forces Aircrew Selection Centre (CFASC) uses cognitively demanding testing that includes MATB-like multitasking assessments for pilot, AEC, and ACSO candidates.[canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/air-force/services/training-education/canadian-forces-aircrew-selection-centre/joining-instructions.html)
    

## Certification and Training Assessment

MATB provides standardized assessment capabilities for evaluating training progress and certification readiness. The battery's controlled environment allows for systematic evaluation of:
